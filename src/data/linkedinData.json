      "content": "Tried Shoffr recently. I used to take BluSmart, but ever since they shut down, I’ve been looking for a ride that doesn’t involve smelly cabs or chaotic drivers. Shoffr felt like a solid upgrade.\n\nThe car showed up before time, so I could actually leave earlier than scheduled. As soon as I stepped in, it was clear they care about the experience. \n\nClean interiors, good hospitality, and a focus on quality. I even managed to get work done and take my morning stand-up before the flight, which almost never happens in most cabs.\n\nThat said, the app experience needs work, a lot of it. To start I couldn’t get the OTP since I wasn’t already a registered user. It just kept throwing a vague error - something went wrong. \n\nBeing an engineer, I debuged that the signup flow might work instead, and it did. But that’s not something most users will figure out on their own. \n\nAlso noticed a bunch of rough UX edges that take away from what is otherwise a premium experience.\n\nShoffr team, if you’re reading this, your on-ground ops are fantastic. But your app should feel as premium as your rides. Happy to hop on a call and share detailed feedback if that’s useful.\n\nKislay Verma",

Willingness to take risk vs. ability to take risk are two different things - and not everyone has the same ability to take risks because we all come from different backgrounds and with different constraints.\n\nI've probably always had high willingness to take risk, but I've also been lucky to have parents and family who have been supportive throughout and ultimately provided me with the ability to take risks. Parents who are financially independent. Two elder brothers who are successful and with steady jobs that act as a shield should anything bad come to pass. Not everyone is this lucky.\n\nWhen I was frustruated few months into my first job at Goldman Sachs, my parents encouraged me to leave if I wasn't learning and to come back home. Same for all other moves I've made in my career and life. Having a home to fall back to if things go wrong, having the comfort that you won't be ridiculed for taking chances that didn't work out - these things boost your ability to take risks, and I admit that I've been luckier than most.\n\nIf I didn't have this backing in my life, it's fair to say that I wouldn't have been able to start and build Shoffr. Nor would I have been able to quit jobs without having another job in hand, nor take career breaks and have the experiences that've shaped my thinking and made me who I am today.\n\nThis one is for my parents and my family - thank you! I wouldn't have been able to even try to do all this without your love and support ❤️",

Certainly did not expect the flagbearers of Indian fintech to actively work to reduce customer choices and interoperability in the payments ecosystem.\n\nNo concrete reasoning has been offered since none exists beyond creating vendor lock-in. If your product is sooo good, you should be able to convince customer to work directly - no need to sever from Juspay. The \"Juspay isn't transparent\" argument is too facile to even acknowledge - a smoke screen to hide the blatantly obvious power grab.\n\nJuspay and other orchestration systems offer merchants the power and freedom to determine the best choices for themselves. This move takes away exactly that.\n\nThe bigger players will invariably go back to implementing orchestration in house (as they used to do before Juspay), and the smaller merchants will be locked in to whichever provider they are forced to choose, with a high cost of switching and no course to optimizations.\n\nShoffr just launched in Delhi, and I want to spend my time and energy building stuff for our new guests. Instead, I'm stuck dealing with payment provider shenanigans for no reason at all.",

So many professionals have reached out to me who do SEO, digital marketing, brand campaigns, PR, etc. - and they are all surprised to hear me say this.\n\nWe don't run ads, we don't send you annoying push notifications or e-mails, we don't collect & harvest your data. Shoffr is being built the way we'd like to experience as users - and I personally hate how most new-age ventures exploit technology to the annoyance and privacy loss of their users.\n\nJust because you can, doesn't mean you always should. I believe there are better ways to build your brand, to encourage repeat user behaviour, to acquire new users. Ones which not only have a much higher ROI if done well, but which most importantly also allow you to do what's right for your users. Users have the potential to be your biggest voice and brand ambassadors - so imo it makes strong business sense (no matter the business) to prioritise taking care of them!\n\nPS: that's me posing with the first Shoffr car (KA-03-AK-4725 will always remain special) when we had no users, no reach, no logo, and no brand..",

I’ve seen BluSmart partner with GripInvest to offer such investment opportunities\n\n(3) Also has a B2C business 📱 \n- You can book airport travel & inter-city travel\n\n🧠 Vozi began operations in early 2023 & it seems to have picked up on the right lessons:\n(a) EV fleet mobility is all about sweating the asset\n- Hence, operating longer distance routes (e.g. airport commutes) are profitable\n(b) EV fleet economics work if you can either charge a premium OR maintain a high # of billable hours\n- Vozi is focused on B2B (i.e. corporate mobility) or inter-city rentals; both of which have a high # of billable hours\n\n💡 As I’ve mentioned in the past, it seems like EV Mobility in India is becoming a localized play: Snap-E Cabs in Kolkata, Cab-E Mobility in Mumbai, Vozi & Shoffr in Bangalore and BluSmart and Uber Green in a few markets.\n\nI wrote about a similar business (Kolkata’s Snap-E Mobility) here: https://lnkd.in/dgQ4hRp8\n\n➡ Quite bullish about such local businesses & it is great to see India’s EV revolution take roots across the country.\n\n#startups #india",

      "content": "If you stay in Bangalore, you would have noticed that a number of black taxis with the logo “Uber Black” have started to appear.\n\nUber Black is the “OG” ride — back when Uber launched its beta in May 2010, you could book a luxury black cab.. This model changed in April ‘13 when ride-sharing (i.e. non-taxi cabs) became the norm…\n\nNow, regarding Uber Black in India:\n\n(1) In Sept ‘24, Uber India re-launched Uber Black — starting with Mumbai.\n\n(2) Back in 2013, when Uber launched in India, Uber Black was the initial product but in a slightly different format → it meant luxury sedans from Mercedes, Audi and BMW which were available to book.\n\n(3) Uber Black is offered by Uber’s fleet partners (e.g. Everest Fleets where it is an investor) i.e. it is a managed fleet services and not a DCO (driver cum owner) model like the regular Ubers\n\n(4) Uber India describes this as the “ business class of back seats” → you get a “quiet mode” option, temperature control etc from your mobile phone\n\n(5) The Uber Black fleet consists of SUVs and MUVs from Toyota and MG. You can also book rentals (fixed hour / fixed distance).\n\n💡Uber India has been tacking the cancellation / quality problem by slowing shifting from the DCO model to the managed fleet model — Uber Black is the 2nd instance, Uber Green is the 1st instance..\n\nNote: Uber Black & Uber Green are examples of “managed fleets” because these 3rd party fleet operators work very closely with Uber. From my experience testing Uber Black: The way I see it → Uber Green == BluSmart, Uber Black == Blusmart Premium.\n\n🧠The choice of vehicles is also smart → SUVs tend to have more boot space (this was a major criticism of BluSmart in early 2023 — until they rolled out the MGs). This will let Uber capture some wallet share of the lucrative airport commute market.\n\nOne could say this is the result competition from BluSmart, Shoffr & other EV fleets etc — but it is admirable to see a company at Uber’s scale respond to ground realities.\n\n➡️ It is fascinating to see how in the past ~3 years, mobility in India is slowing moving away from “marketplace” model & closer to the “OG Meeru model” i.e. managed fleets.\n\n#india",

They refuse to keep a car and driver, saying 'BluSmart hai na.' Whenever they have to go somewhere and I offer to arrange a premium car service I trust, they respond, 'BluSmart hai na. Rental kar lenge.'”\n\nHe added, “I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I know they'll be heartbroken when I tell them 'Ab BluSmart nahi hai.'”\n\nTo this, the Shoffr founder replied, “Our team at @shoffr_in would be honoured to serve your parents. Let us know when they need a ride next time.”\n\nVerma responded to several other users as well.\n\nOne X user wrote, “Very privileged take but BluSmart was the only service that felt secure enough that one could doze off by mistake also and won’t wake up to regret it. Clean cabs with surety of turning up come what may. Generational wealth ka scope tha. All gone for a Camellias flat.”\n\nThe electric cab service was quickly rising as an alternative in India’s metro cities.\n\nThe app, though available on the Play Store, now shows no available time slots or booking dates, effectively pausing its operations without an official statement.\n\nBluSmart’s parent company, Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL), faces serious allegations from SEBI.\n\nIn an interim order, SEBI accused promoters Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi of taking loans for the company and then diverting and misusing the funds.\n\n#startuppedia #startup #blusmart #cabservice #startupfounder",

Any thoughts on this?\n\n🗻 The landscape of EV only fleet startups currently is:\n(a) NCR, BLR & Bangalore - BluSmart\n(b) NCR, BLR & Bangalore - Everest Fleet (Uber Green)\n(c) Hyderabad - Ohm E-Logistics\n(d) Mumbai - Cab-E Mobility\n(e) Kolkata - Snap-E Mobility\n(f) Bangalore - Shoffr \n\nSome further thoughts on the landscape can be found here: https://lnkd.in/dYehaXh3\n\n➡ Almost 4 months ago, I had written that India's EV mobility revolution seems to be a \"local\" market play versus a \"pan India\" play. I continue to stand by it!\n\n#india",

I don’t have an official number but I believe more than a hundred thousand people attended.\n\nIt was startup central, with hundreds of startups exhibiting, including big names like Glean, Rubrik, and Pixxel.\n\nGot to meet new people, and discuss what they are working on, and some ideas were so cool, I briefly considered stealing the idea 😈 (Just kidding...or am I?)\n\nHighlight: We met Vikas Bardia, CFA, one of the judges and the founder of Shoffr. His insights, I tell you, are truly mind-blowing. \n\nSilver lining? Shell arranged flights for us. So, free trip? I'll take it.\n\nAll said and done, can't complain too much. New faces, mind-bending ideas, and a runner-up title. Onward and upward, right?\n\nBig shoutout to Shell, Suryanarayanan R, Divyanshu Vyas and the entire organizing team for pulling off this amazing event and thanks to Owen O'Connell, Ankit Bansal for sharing the stage with us as award presenters 🙌\n\n#ShellAI #hackathon #OperationsResearch #DecisionScience",

      "content": "Goodbye OLA & UBER.\n\nSay hello to BluSmart & Shoffr!\n\nEV startups like BluSmart and Shoffr are disrupting Ola and Uber in India’s ride-hailing market.\n\nBut why EVs?\n\nBecause they create the margins that enable this disruption to happen.\n\nEvery single ride in an EV happens at a much lower cost compared to an ICE vehicle.\n\nThe lower cost ensures that EV firms can price themselves as Ola/Uber but operate at a fraction of their costs.\n\nThey have a promising strategy, too.\n\nBluSmart:\nIn 2019, BluSmart, founded by Anmol Jaggi, Punit K Goyal, Tushar Garg, Anirudh Arun, & Rishabh Sood, entered the market, challenging conventions with its all-electric cab service. Focusing on providing an eco-friendly, reliable, and economical alternative to traditional ride-hailing.\n\nShoffr:\nStarted in November 2022 when Vikas Bardia, and Kislay Verma came together to redefine taxi services in Bangalore. With a vision of setting the gold standard for cab rides, dedicated to ensuring comfort and convenience.\n\nBut what are the key aspects that contribute to their success:\n\n1.Punctuality and Communication: On-time pick-ups without the need for location confirmation calls demonstrate reliability and efficiency.\n\n2.Quality Fleet: Offering a BYD EV SUV as a standard option represents a commitment to providing a premium and environmentally conscious ride.\n\n3.Clean and Well-Maintained Vehicles: The emphasis on cleanliness and regular servicing reflects a dedication to ensuring a comfortable and hygienic experience for passengers.\n\n4.Customer Assistance: The driver's proactive approach in assisting with luggage adds a personal touch, making the experience feel more like having a chauffeur.\n\n5.Route Customization: Providing options for toll-road or alternate routes based on passenger preferences shows a commitment to accommodating individual needs.\n\n6.Transparent Payment Process: Despite the initial skepticism about paying the full fee upfront, the transparency in the payment process appears to contribute to a seamless experience.\n\nPositive experience and assistance with Seamless operations management are a testament to the impact of exceptional customer service.\n\nIt's indeed true that customer referrals play a vital role in the growth and success of businesses, especially in the service industry.\n\nSo, do you recognize this branded of cabs from Bangalore?\n\nProbably because Uber & Ola have dropped our expectations so low that anything marginally better is a great experience.🤣\n\nBut jokes aside, these two were just a perfect match for comfort and convenience.❤️\n\nIt's clear that BluSmart & Shoffr has successfully created a service that resonates with customers and goes beyond the expectations set by other ride-hailing platforms.\n\nWishing BluSmart & Shoffr continued success in providing outstanding service to its customers!\n\nThank You😊\nFollow Subhrakanti for more updates! 🚀",

To put it simply: Uber XL was almost 20% pricier than Shoffr! (Not sure if it’s initial promotional pricing, but hey—I’ll take it!)\n\nThe ride was comfortable, cabs were spotless and smelled great, and the chauffeur, Ajay Kumar, was exceptionally professional, calm, and patient. He even proactively offered assistance with my luggage (though I politely declined, as it wasn't necessary!).\n\nThe only drawback? Shoffr currently offers only XL/SUV category vehicles, so it might not make economic sense for solo travelers. But for planned XL/SUV rides, this is my new go-to recommendation, especially for females traveling late at night—100% recommended.\n\nKislay Verma Vikas Bardia, CFA - A request: Build slow, steady, and meaningfully.

You feel like a King, and no surprises, the company does ~ $100M in annual bookings in just ~3 years of starting!!\n\nFound out a few interesting facts about Wheely & its global peers:\n\n(1) About Wheely 🛬 \n- Raised ~$28M in venture funding; was founded in 2010 in UK but did a major pivot to luxury mobility in 2018.\n- Has ~ 3.5K chauffer's: 90% of whom are owner-operators i.e. Wheely doesn’t itself own the fleet but acts like a “Uber” type of marketplace.\n- Live in select cities: London, Paris, Moscow, Saint Petersburg. The fleet is Mercedes only!\n- Their “products” are super interesting\n(a) The usual airport transfers & day rental\n(b) “Concierge” service where the chauffer will run errands for you\n- They have an invite only membership program (need 15 trips done in 6 months to be eligible)\n\n🤯 Fun fact about Wheely: Chauffer's undergo a 3 day “coaching academy” and have to sign an NDA since some of the guests want serious privacy.\n\nI discovered Wheely via British Airways.. And, I discovered its peer Blacklane via Emirates Airlines; an equally fascinating business:\n\n(2) About Blacklane 🚖 \n- It started in 2011 in Germany, raised $36M in venture funding to date\n- Blacklane is profitable and does ~ $220M in revenue\n- Similar to Wheely, it has an airport transfer & per hour option. But, it has a unique city to city model (e.g. Dubai to Abu Dhabi) based on frequent luxury travel routes.\n- Blacklane has an all electric fleet in Dubai\n- While Wheely doesn’t operate in India, Blacklane operates in India as well\n\nNaturally, all topics for me come back to “is there an Indian equivalent?” And, the answer is yes!\n\n(3) Peers in India 🏡 \n- Chauffer driven: Shoffr is live in BLR for airport commutes with high end BYD vehicles. Started last year, it has publicly announced crossing ~$1M in bookings fully bootstrapped & profitable.\n- Rental only: Hype Luxury started in 2017 for premium & luxury vehicle rental.\n- Obviously, the Indian list is not complete - would love to hear more examples from you\n\n💡 I have spent a LOT of time studying the EV mobility unit economics (via BluSmart) - Shoffr’s model is the closest to “ideal” wherein you combine high asset utilization (airport runs) with premium pricing. It is sort of a \"Blacklane for India\".\n\n➡ Personally, I’m quite bullish on a business like Shoffr - my investment memo can be found here: https://lnkd.in/d59nQV-u - rooting for their success: There is a market for such premium chauffer services & even better if it can be done via Green mobility!\n\n#startups #india",

      "content": "Recently Shoffr announced $1 million in funding from a 'user-only' community, an unusual route for raising investments. \n\nFor context, Shoffr offers premium/luxury ride-hailing services for airport rides in Bengaluru, selected intercity trips, and rentals with all-electric BYD SUV cars.\n\nThey started hyper-locally with just two cars focused on BLR airport rides and scaled profitably to $1.5 million ARR with 75 cars in 15 months while remaining bootstrapped.\n\nIt's interesting why they chose to start with airport rides:\n- BLR airport's cab market is a $145 million market and one of the most profitable and predictable routes (as per Ken).\n- Ride-hailing is a chicken-and-egg problem with supply and demand. By keeping the destination fixed, they can work on demand predictability and build the supply (drivers and EVs) accordingly.\n\nI have been a frequent user for all my BLR airport rides, and here are my observations:\n- Generally 15-20% higher priced than their peers (Uber, Ola SUV segments) but No surge pricing, so during peak hours, it will be similar pricing.\n- Cars are super clean and offer you a feeling of luxury.\n- So far all bookings are through website. It's a simple website that handles the booking.\n- Drivers are extremely polite.\n- Drivers' incentives are based on customer ratings.\n- They also have the option to include pets in traveling (with additional charges).\n\nThings that inspired me as a business model\n- The founder himself used to handle customer service support to stay closer to customers.\n- Probably 100% of business is driven by word-of-mouth and high retention cohorts. \n- Taking conscious and well researched call before any growth plans which makes business sense (choosing EV car maker, route plans, hiring etc.) \n- Scaling and growing without losing the sight on the customer satisfaction and profitability\n- Saying NO to things that doesn't align with the Shoffr's vision and values.\n\nAs Vikas quotes in his investment announcement post - 'Shoffr is neither just a dhandha nor just a startup - it's an attempt to take the best of both and build a new-age business.'\n\nCertainly, Shoffr is an unconventional business, turning the tables of a high capex business to a lean, sustainable one with a strong focus on customer satisfaction, operating margin, and profitability from day one, setting gold standards in the ecosystem.\n\nYou can also read the investment memo by Rahul Mathur, who has detailed the business model, TAM, revenue, growth plans, and risks - https://lnkd.in/gvDDqZjk\n\nIf you are traveling to/from BLR airports, you should definitely give Shoffr a try. \n\n\n#The10XJournal",

While these incidents are stressful and often ppl choose to write about such experiences on various social media platforms quite vividly, it's not equally true for positive experiences. \nThis can create a broad sentiment and can further widen the gap between different cultural groups.\n\nI would like to share an incident which helped me overcome some pre-conceived notions wrt bangalore cab experience and local cab drivers.\n\nI had booked a Shoffr cab to the airport for some relatives. The entire journey was pleasant and uneventful except that my relative had inadvertently dropped 2 ceremonial cash envelopes containing Rs 11k each from his jacket pocket.\n\nWe realised this approx 30 mins after the ride had ended and contacted Mr Harish V, the cab driver, not very hopeful of recovering the money on account of pre-conceived notions about the local cab experiences. However, to our surprise and pleasure Mr Harish stopped his car in the middle of the highway on his way back to the cab depot, found the envelope, took my permission to count the cash, confirmed the amount in both the envelopes and deposited it at the depot office ! That too without any expectation for a return favour. \n\nIn my experience this was one of the finest lessons in personal integrity i learnt from Mr Harish. A person working in a blue collared job with harsh work requirements and hours, effortlessly chose to return Rs 22,000 without a second thought !! This experience would act as a constant reminder and motivation to preserve integrity in all circumstances.\n\nThanking Shoffr for the right training and culture.\n#bangalore Cabs #shoffr",

      "content": "Last week, Uber India invested a further $30M into Everest Fleets (the company which operates Uber Green)\n\nEverest was valued at ~$425M in this round; and it is believed that IFC may invest a further ~$20M — bringing the Series C total investment to ~$50M.. This is a company worth spending some time studying:\n\n(1) The Uber <> Everest Fleet relationship 🤝\n\n- Everest Fleet Pvt. Ltd. had traditionally provided an ICE fleet to Uber; back in 2023, per the company, ~80% of their 10K vehicles were operating on Uber’s platform\n- Uber is doubling down on its investment & strategic partnership in a big way: In June 2023, Uber India infused ~$20M into Everest Fleets. \n\nPS: Like I said a year ago, we like to believe most Ubers are DCO (Driver Cum Owners) but in reality they are fleet vehicles run by proper companies (like Everest) which provide the stable supply\n\n(2) About Everest Cabs 🤔\n\n- It is a Mumbai headquartered fleet business started in 2016 by Siddharth Ladsariya (who is a prolific Angel investor & owner of a manufacturing unit)\n- Everest is profitable: ₹41 crore of PAT in FY 23 (FY24 PAT is not known; but FY 24 revenue was ~₹1,000 crore which is > x2 the FY 23 revenue of ~₹460 crore)\n- Everest has an interesting model wherein 2/3rds of vehicles are leased using the firm’s own money & 1/3rd of vehicles are leased from 3rd party investors (like you & me) — this is a model which even Blusmart uses\n\n(3) Everest is Uber’s “weapon” against BluSmart & other managed fleet models ⚔️\n\n- Running an EV fleet requires heavy CAPEX — something which BluSmart, Shoffr & other managed fleets have taken on\n- Uber is using its relationship with Everest to offer a managed fleet experience (Uber Green) as an alternative to BluSmart & others.\n- Uber India has done a fab job of tackling the “innovators dilemma” here :)\n\nPS: For those curious, a conservative profit estimate for FY24 might be ~₹80 crore (or ~$10M) which means this round of financing ascribes a PE of ~42.5 times. This is a bit higher than its listed peer (albeit slightly different model) - WTiCabs (which trades at ~28 PE). But, Everest has a much larger fleet (~17.7K vehicles versus 8K of WTiCabs)\n\n➡️Everest Cabs had taken an ambitious target of building an EV fleet of ~10K vehicles by 2026. The company has raised ~₹550 crore in debt financing from multiple institutions like Kotak Mahindra, SIDBI, ICICI Bank etc (has a BBB+ credit rating).\n\nSid & team have built a fantastic business — given their earliest investor Artha Venture Fund a great partial exit.

I feel that this is the beginning of any journey, whatever newness you bring into your life for the development of yourself and others!\n\nAn example of this occurred during my family's recent trip from #Bengaluru to #Patna #Bihar ... A few questions to consider when arranging your airport trip >?..\n\n⁉ 1. How can we commute from home to the airport? flights are usually in the morning. A larger family equals more luggage, therefore you need a good boot space in your cab 🚕 \n- ANSWER, I booked the latest EV taxi 🚕 entrant in Bengaluru #Shoffr offering large boot space, environment and pocket friendly. Top of it - no nonsense mobile app!\n\n⁉ 2. How do we deal with the long queue at the 🛫 departure, boarding, and security checkpoint gates? Average time to cross all check points, anything between 15-30-45 minutes, which was rather unpleasant.\n- ANSWER, one answer #digiyatra .. a revolutionary tech - utilizes facial recognition to verify passenger identities at various checkpoints, without the need for physical documents. I sincerely THANKS the pillar behind this initiative Suresh Khadakbhavi 🙏 \n- I would also like to THANK #indigoairlines IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd) for automating almost everything to make our life so smooth! We zipped to the boarding pass kiosk - printed our pass and baggage tags, our bags were ready (5 mins)... Zipped and dropped bags at the drop gate - 7 mins!\n\ncommon is this last hurdle >> ooops nope!\n\n⁉ 3. You have children in your family, restless and desperate to reach the destination > target lounges or restaurants at the airport ? >> I am confused 😕 \n- ANSWER, choice is yours, but if you have the latest #hdfcbank  💳  credit card along add on family card - drop in the exclusive lounge! ... 👑 king style!\n\nMy comfort - my family' comfort, was not just thought by me, but rather by thriving new technologies prospering around the ecosystem of NEW BHARAT 🇮🇳 ..\n< Pls remember these are my views and experience, not financially motivated or endorsed >\n#Bharat #Technology #LinkedIn #Family #Life #Travel #Growth",

The driver wasn’t just impeccably dressed; he went above and beyond. Helped with my luggage, opened the door, offered water and was soft-spoken throughout the ride. To top it off, he even offered to connect the Bluetooth so I could play my preferred music—a small gesture that made the ride feel personal and thoughtful.\n\nThis level of guest experience isn’t accidental. It’s the result of a culture where drivers genuinely care and take pride in representing the brand.\n\nBeing at Draper Startup House, I’ve seen how these extra steps can create memorable experiences. Kudos to Vikas Bardia, CFA and Kislay Verma for building something truly special. Looking forward to my next ride! #bangalore",

For places at the edges of these ranges, Google maps can sometimes show different routes leading to different prices. We identified such places among our most frequent guest locations and made sure the price remains stable\n- Drivers can record the payment method used by the customer (Cash/UPI) in their app now.\n\nAll this and a bunch of smaller stuff, bug fixes, etc\n\nVikas Bardia, CFA and I are switching gears into growing our fleet and revenue over the next few weeks.

(i.e. drive high utilization OR premium pricing OR both)\n(b) How do you scale from YY to YYY? (i.e. don’t have too many quality issues at x10 scale)\n(c) OEM risk? (i.e. will the preferred OEM continue to drop prices? And, will battery life pan out?)\n\n➡ Over the next 10 years, we should see most ICE cab fleets get replaced with such EV cab fleets. Clear winners in OEM segment are visible: Tata Motors & MG Motors India.. Will be exciting to see who wins (on the fleet operator side) in this transition!\n\n#startups #india",

      "content": "Tesla is launched in India, and the Model Y costs you 'just' Rs. 60 lakh.....But, the real cost of owning this is Rs. 208/km...Should I buy or not?\n\nThis morning, I read the news that @Tesla has finally opened its first showroom in #Mumbai.\n\nLike so many of us, I got excited. It's Electric, Sexy, Sustainable. The Tesla badge. But here’s a question in my mind:\n\nIs buying a Tesla Model Y in India actually worth it? Or are you better off just booking an Ola/Uber/Shoffr SUV and letting someone else deal with our traffic madness?\n\nSo, the analyst in me quickly ran with a few numbers...\n\nLet’s say you buy a Tesla Model Y for Rs 60 lakh and drive it for 15 years, clocking 1.5 lakh km. (Indian conditions)\n\n- Tesla Y Model in India: Rs 60,00,000\n - Charging cost (avg Rs 7/unit): Rs 1,65,000\n - Total spend = Rs 61,65,000\n\nThat works out to Rs 41.10 per km.\n(And that’s before you even factor in insurance, tyres, or surprise repairs.)\n\nNow, make a note, it's you who would be in the driving seat...So additional investment of your time.\n\nHere’s the thing… driving in India can feel like a full-time job:\n\n- Endless traffic\n- Horns blaring\n- Road rage lurks around every corner\n- Parking nightmares\n\nYou must be earning at least Rs 80 lakh per annum to buy such a car...Factor 8 hours working, 20 working days a month for 15 years, 1.5 Lakh Km driving at avg 25km/hr speed. (Indian condition).\n\nYour TRUE COST PER KM to own a Tesla Y Model, including your time, is insane ....Rs 208/km !!!\n\nJust take an Ola/Uber/Shoffr, instead?\n\nHop into an Ola / Uber SUV for ~Rs 25–35/km, or book a premium Shoffr ride for ~Rs 50–70/km (As I do, and take on Rent for 4-6 hours to avoid P2P booking hassle).\n\nSit in the back seat, sip your coffee, and utilize the same time to finish a few important calls while being on the road. \n\nCheery on the Cake - No Rs 60 lakh upfront. No resale headache. No Maintenance, No frequent  Charging...........and most importantly - no stress behind the wheel.\n\nSo… Buy or Don’t Buy?\n\nI personally feel that if you love driving, want to make a statement, and have the cash, then Tesla is tempting.\n\nIf you’d rather save your time, sanity, and cash flow, then stick with cabs and let someone else handle the chaos.\n\nBecause while Rs 41/km on papers is already on the higher side, the real cost is much higher....Rs 208/km.... that makes even premium chauffeur rides look like a bargain.\n\nBuying a Tesla Model Y in India isn’t just about money, it’s about time. If you love driving and it’s your therapy, maybe it’s worth it.\n\nBut if you’d rather want to invest that Rs 60 Lakh in an appreciating asset and spend those 6,000 hours living life, building your career, or being with your family… Ola, Uber, or Shoffr might be the smarter choice.\n\n#Tesla #EV #India #TeslaInIndia #TeslaIndia #TeslaModelY #TeslaShowroom",

      "content": "India is starting to see the “customers & community round” emerge as a credible alternative to raising the traditional Pre-Seed or Seed round.\n\n☑️In 2024 itself, we’ve seen some notable examples of the C&C round:\n\n(1) Shoffr (EV Mobility | $1M Pre-Seed) - entirely from its customers\n\n(2) BONOMI (D2C Brands | < $500K Pre-Seed) - entirely from Twitter friends & customers\n\n(3) Pneucons (B2B Marketplace | < $1M Seed) - entirely from Twitter friends & customers\n\nPS: I'm a big fan of all 3 founders - Vardhman from BONOMI, Vikas from Shoffr and Pritesh from Pneucons.\n\nAnd, I’d bet Mlada (D2C Brands | Women’s Fashion) might also go down the same route IFF they decide to raise 3rd party money\n\n🧠Few important points to understand about the C&C round:\n\n(1) The amount of money raised here is much more (>> $300K) than what a typical Friends & Family round involves (<< $150K)\n(2) Therefore, the C&C round is somewhat competitive to a micro-VC\n(3) And, unlike an F&F round, a C&C round also has “complete outsiders” (e.g. customers of the product who the Founder may not even know by name) \n(4) C&C rounds are mostly a deliberate attempt by the Founder to raise non-institutional money (i.e. VCs may want to invest but the Founder isn’t keen to take their money)\n\n⚠️Now, some legal caveats on the C&C round:\n\n(a) The investments are made through RUVs (Roll Up Vehicles) sponsored by AIFs (regulated investment entities)\n\n(b) Therefore, all the individual investors in the C&C round need to satisfy SEBI guidelines for private market investing (the sponsor AIFs make sure this is adhered to)\n\n(c) Naturally, the pricing & terms of such rounds are led by the Founder (due to the lack of an institution). And, the company may not undergo as deep a DD as when an institution is involved.\n\n➡️ I’d expect to see more and larger C&C rounds (especially in Consumer Brands & other tangible products) in the coming days. As someone said: “Why should the institutional chaps have all the fun?”\n\n#startups #india #venturecapital",

Driver arived well before time and was the most professional, kind, humble man. \n2. The Vehicles feel like a super luxe experience. We paid approx 1700 for a 60 km intercity trip, and felt it to be 10x better than anything else.\n3. Insanely clean vehicle.(yes its new but then Vikas Bardia, CFA and I spoke, I am very very hopeful they will do the right things as they scale.) \n4. Small touches - 5 Litres of water, Fresh Newspaper, Napkins and even cute candies. Driver tells you about these.\n5. No smell, no footmarks, No crumbs, spotless through and through. \n6. The Byd 6 Seater Ev felt absolutely top notch. Ac, airbags, Entertainment system. Fully loaded. \n\nIts one of those experiences you want to tell everyone and I did :)\n\nSo Delhi folks - For those who can and want to experience 'better than your own driver experience' - Try out Shoffr .\n\nThey're also doing Corporate Tie-ups for regular use cases, so do approach them.",

I wasn’t expecting much — just needed to get around without complications. Especially since my flight landed at 3 am and the journey between the airport and the city can be harrowing, if not planned properly.\n\nBut the experience clearly stood out:\n• Simple booking process\n• No last-minute cancellations\n• Clean, spacious car\n• Courteous, professional driver\n\nNow, with BluSmart exiting the market, I couldn’t help but reflect upon that experience. \n\nThere is only one cab service in India that outplays the customer experience that Blusmart was appreciated for!\n\nShoffr!\n\nWhat makes it even more meaningful for me is that Vikas Bardia, CFA , a senior from school and scouting days, is behind it. Vikas always led with integrity and honesty — and it shows in the way Shoffr values its customers!\n\nShoffr operates in Delhi NCR and Bangalore. Give it a shot guys, especially works beautifully for the airport picks and drops!",

Within six months, I was promoted from a waiter to the hotel’s accountant.\n\nAfter that, I joined an engineering college and started another venture with my close friend. \n\nWe ran it successfully for 4.5 years, earning over ₹35 lakhs annually, serving 150 big clients in Kolkata, and even setting up a luxury office. But eventually, it shut down.\n\nAt the same time, I ran another company, similar to Farmely, for a year. \n\nThat also didn’t work out.\n\nI then joined BYJU'S, worked there for three months, and left because it didn’t align with my goals. \n\nAfter that, I moved on to work with Gully Cricket, Tearaja, and Shoffr. These were exciting and valuable experiences in my life.\n\nSo, why am I sharing all this?\n\nFour months ago, I joined Amwoodo as part of the Founder’s Office. \n\nI now feel like I’m doing work I’m truly passionate about—for both the organization and myself. \n\nI’ve had the privilege of working with an incredible founder, Mr. Agni Mitra, who I deeply admire and respect. \n\nWorking for him and for Amwoodo has been an amazing experience.\n\nAt Amwoodo, my ethics and core values align perfectly with the company’s value system. \n\nFor me, Amwoodo and Mr. Agni Mitra are the most important parts of my professional life right now.\n\nEverything ,What I’ve manifested over the past few years is finally coming true. \n\nIf everything goes well in the next few times, my life will change for sure.\n\nAfter all of this, I have just one goal in my life:\n\n\"I want the startup industry to know my name: Subhrakanti Das\"\n\nThank you so much to Amwoodo and Mr. Agni Mitra for giving me this opportunity.\n\nLots of love and respect❤️",

Bookings still go via the original platform.\nNo commissions from drivers. \n\nBut for the end customer—a small subscription fee. One they’d gladly pay for a clean cab, a well-behaved and safe driver and peace of mind. (That's what BluSmart stood for, right?) This doesn’t need to be rocket science. It just needs to work.\n\nNow let’s talk about the part nobody’s really talking about.\nWhile everyone is busy discussing how investors lost money in the BluSmart fiasco...\nI can’t stop thinking about the 10,000+ drivers who may not have the entrepreneurial flexibility or smartness to just “switch” platforms.\nDrivers who take pride in earning that 5-star rating after every ride.\nDrivers who lose sleep over a single 1-star review.\nDrivers who were made to believe they were part of a revolution.\nAnd all of this—just to fuel someone’s dream of buying a home in The Camellias!\n (I'm not against founders buying luxury homes, truly.

      "content": "When you think about an EV fleet in India - you might have this image of a BluSmart fleet full of the standard Tata Tigor EVs. \n\nAnd, you’re not alone - most of us are now accustomed to travelling via Tata Tigor EVs. BUT, will this remain true in the future?\n\n📊 Let’s look at India’s EV 4 wheeler data from 2023:\n\n(1) Tata Motors closed with 60K sales viz 32K in 2022\n(2) MG India closed with 9.5K sales viz 3.5K in 2022\n(3) BYD India closed with 2K sales viz 0.3K in 2022\n\nNote: There are some others like Citroën but the above 3 have been pushing for sales into fleet operators which is the focus today. \n\nAlthough Tata Motors is still the 1st by a HUGE margin; its market share has fallen from ~80% to 70%. Let’s go into the micro:\n\n(a) In 2023, MG India supplied 500 EV SUVs to BluSmart alone\n-i.e. ~ 1/10th of BluSmart’s EV fleet is this SUV (which you can book via the Premium rides on longer routes / airport commutes)\n\n(b) At end of 2023, BYD delivered ~50 EVs to Shoffr (EV fleet in BLR)\n- BYD had earlier planned to invest ~$1bn into local production capability - BUT this was rejected by the GOI.\n\n💡 Now, we all have this romantic idea of a fleet with a single vehicle type - which is driven by our fascination with airline LCCs (Low Cost Carriers) e.g. Indigo Airlines & the Airbus A320 and Southwest Airlines & Boeing 737..\n\nIF you read BluSmart’s app reviews - you’ll quickly realize that a “one size fits all” cab does NOT make sense. Have you travelled with a family & luggage to the airport in a Tigor EV? You’d need to sit on your bags (even if you can do that)..\n\n🧠 Hence, MG India & other players have a huge opportunity to break into the fleet segment with vehicles larger than a sedan e.g. a premium SUV like the MG ZS… Although Tata Motors has its Nexon EV variant - I have seen this in any fleets (as yet, but happy to be corrected)\n\n➡ So here’s the broad contours for competition in sales to the EV fleet:\n\n- Short distance / economy commute hatchback: Tata Motor’s Tiago will face competition from MG’s Comet\n- Medium distance commute sedan: Tata Motors has the clear lead\n- Long distance / premium commute SUV: Tata Motors needs to break MG’s lead here\n\nAnd, most fleet operators will mix & match across OEMs to ensure they don’t have a supply chain disruption risk.\n\nSadly, BYD is out of the race right now due to its plant permissions NOT being provided; MG & Tata Motors build the EVs locally..\n\n➡ Therefore, my bet is that by end of 2024 - we’ll see Tata & MG become the top 2 contenders of EV fleet sales in India. It won’t just be a Tata world!\n\n#india #electricvehicles",

Even when we try to unplug, we can’t help but rely on it — it’s deeply woven into our lives.\n\nAs developers, we live at the heart of this world. Whether we’re designing scalable systems, crafting elegant algorithms, or building LLM-powered assistants — every line of code brings a new challenge, and a new chance to learn.\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by the “how” behind the tech we use every day.\n\nHow does it scale? \nWhy did they choose that architecture? \nWhat decisions shaped the product we love?\n\nThis curiosity led me to start something I’ve been wanting to do for a while — a podcast that dives deep into the minds behind the code.\n\nIntroducing: \"Picking Founders' Brains\" — a podcast where I sit down with brilliant technologists and builders to explore the engineering stories behind successful products.\n\nIn our very first episode, I had the pleasure of speaking with Kislay Verma, Co-founder and CTO of Shoffr.\n\nWe cover a lot:\n- Kislay’s journey from developer to founder\n- The evolution of Shoffr’s tech stack\n- Why they made key system design decisions\n- And the age-old question: Do simple solutions really work?\n\nThis episode is packed with insights, lessons, and honest reflections from someone who’s been building at scale.\n\nI had a blast recording it — and if you're someone who loves learning about tech from the ground up, I think you’ll enjoy it too.\n\nCheck it out, and if it resonates, I’d love for you to like, share, or drop your thoughts in the comments.\n\nMore episodes are on the way — and I can’t wait to take you along on this journey.\n\nLink to the episode: https://lnkd.in/gz-BJSwS\n\nCheers, 🌿",

      "content": "BluSmart, once considered a cleaner, premium alternative to ride-hailing companies like Ola and Uber, has ceased new ride bookings in Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru due to the proceedings of SEBI’s investigation into financial misconduct. \n\nAmid the turmoil, Kislay Verma, the founder of Shoffr, a Bengaluru-based premium car service provider, has quickly seized the opportunity, responding to frustrated users complaining about the sudden unavailability of the BluSmart service.\n\nFor instance, a user shared how BluSmart had become part of his family’s life:\n\n“My elderly parents in Delhi have an unwavering faith in BluSmart. They refuse to keep a car and driver, saying 'BluSmart hai na.' Whenever they have to go somewhere and I offer to arrange a premium car service I trust, they respond, 'BluSmart hai na. Rental kar lenge.'”\n\nHe added, “I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I know they'll be heartbroken when I tell them 'Ab BluSmart nahi hai.'”\n\nTo this, the Shoffr founder replied, “Our team at @shoffr_in would be honoured to serve your parents. Let us know when they need a ride next time.”\n\nVerma responded to several other users as well.\n\nOne X user wrote, “Very privileged take but BluSmart was the only service that felt secure enough that one could doze off by mistake also and won’t wake up to regret it. Clean cabs with surety of turning up come what may. Generational wealth ka scope tha. All gone for a Camellias flat.”\n\nThe electric cab service was quickly rising as an alternative in India’s metro cities.\n\nThe app, though available on the Play Store, now shows no available time slots or booking dates, effectively pausing its operations without an official statement.\n\nBluSmart’s parent company, Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL), faces serious allegations from SEBI.\n\nIn an interim order, SEBI accused promoters Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi of taking loans for the company and then diverting and misusing the funds.\n\n#startuppedia #startup #blusmart #cabservice #startupfounder",

Shell also demonstrated its own suite of technologies like Shell Recharge and the Electric Vehicle Engineering Cockpit, which help drive their sustainability goals. It featured ideas such as Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage and even Rice Decarbonisation.\n\nThere was even a 'Startup Island' featured over 50 startups focusing on affordable & sustainable solutions.\n\nThe Shell.ai Keynote, led by Dan Jeavons, highlighted the creativity and ingenuity behind solutions shaping the future of energy and technology. The Shell.ai Awards ceremony was dedicated to recognizing and celebrating the most innovative ideas within Shell.\n\nAs the event came to a close, Shell surprised us by virtually inviting Ferrari F1 racers – Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr. to join the celebration.\n\nI also had the pleasure of meeting Dan Jeavons, besides Hariharasudhan Ramani, Rishabh Chopra and Saptarshi Das, Ph.D.. Despite the long day, the energy in the atmosphere was just as high as when the event began.\n\nAttending this event, dedicated to sustainability and Net-Zero, was truly amazing. It showcased the incredible innovation happening in this space and demonstrated how committed Shell is to its Net-Zero goals.\n\nTo everyone I met, thank you for making this event such a remarkable experience. I’m already looking forward to attending next year’s event.\n\n#Shell #ChangemakersofTomorrow #NetZero #Sustainability #DigitalInnovation",

And post-COVID, with travel increasing rapidly, one experience kept getting worse—airport travel.\n\n-Unclean, poorly maintained cabs\n-Drivers pushing for offline bookings (goodbye safety!)\n-Long queues and friction at the airport hub\n-Lingual discrimination creeping in\n-No consistency in experience. \n…and the list goes on. \n\nThen, sometime in late 2022-early 2023 , I started spotting  these sleek black BYD e6 cars with golden branding: Shoffr  \n\nFounded by Vikas Bardia, CFA , and Kislay Verma ,  aims to reimagine the airport commute—and the tagline “The gold standard of rides” fits perfectly.\n\nI took my first ride with them in late 2023, and since then—no looking back.\nOnly for airport rides. Always reliable.\n\nHere’s what stands out:\n- Effortless pre-booking & pre-payment\n- No last-minute cancellations\n- BYD e6s are clean, polished, and well-maintained\n- Thoughtful touches: water, mints, newspaper\n- Polite, professional on-payroll drivers\n- Hassle-free airport pickups\n- Zero cancellation fees\n- Economically priced—often cheaper than surge fares, and even when slightly higher, the experience makes it worth every rupee.\n\nYou don’t need flashy ads when your service speaks for itself.\nThis is how you raise a customer’s willingness to pay—not with gimmicks, but with consistency and care.\n\nWas in Bangalore yesterday after 10 months, used Shoffr again, and felt compelled to write this.\n\nThe best part? They’re expanding—now in Delhi too.\n\nVikas – Loved the app’s city-specific touches. Hope to see MH-03 and TS-04 on there soon!\n\n\nHave you used Shoffr  yet ? \n\nMention in the comments \n\n#CustomerExperience #Startups #Shoffr #AirportRides #GoldStandard",

What truly stands out is their groundbreaking approach to funding—they’ve successfully raised $1.1 million from their very own customers. This speaks volumes about the trust and loyalty they've cultivated, transforming satisfied users into investors.\n\nStarting with just two cars focused on airport rides, Shoffr has grown to a fleet of 60+ cars and hit $1.5 million in ARR, all while staying bootstrapped. They chose airport routes, a highly profitable segment, to ensure demand predictability and manage supply effectively.\n\nFrom a user’s perspective, I can vouch for their service quality. Despite being slightly pricier than others like Uber or Ola, Shoffr offers no surge pricing, luxurious and clean cars, and exceptionally polite drivers. Their website is straightforward for bookings, and you can even travel with your pets!\n\nSeeing a company not just meet but exceed customer expectations to the point where those very customers become investors is incredibly motivating. It’s a testament to Shoffr's commitment to their users and their vision.\n\nIf you’re heading to or from BLR airport anytime soon, giving Shoffr.in a try might just change the way you think about city travel.",

      "content": "Revfin, an #electricvehicle lender, has raised $14 million in an equity investment round sponsored by Omidyar Network. Sameer Aggarwal, the company's #founder and CEO, stated that practically all of the #money was in the form of primary capital. He did not reveal the valuation used to raise the cash.\n\nAsian Development Bank, Companion Capital, and current #investors Green Frontiers Capital and LC Nueva also contributed to the money raise. This comes as Omidyar Network, the #fund founded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, prepares to leave India after more than a decade in the nation.\n\nAccording to Aggarwal, Revfin has raised Rs 280 crore in debt this year, which it would largely utilize to provide loans and expand its #business. It is now trying to raise Rs 500 crore in debt over the next three to six months, he said.\n\nRevfin has so far raised Rs 625 crore, of which Rs 450 crore is debt. Omidyar Network contributed $5 million in the most recent equity round, Companion Capital invested $3.8 million, and the Asian Development Bank invested $2.5 million.\n\nRevfin, which operates in 23 states, will utilize the capital to expand operations, according to Aggarwal. The money would also be used by the company to increase its market share in categories such as three-wheeler electric vehicle finance, as well as to expand into #batteryfinancing, charging infrastructure financing, etc. \n\nThe company offers finance to #EVconsumers in the two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and four-wheeler segments. Though it works with fleet operators such as Bengaluru-based Shoffr, roughly 80% of its business originates from direct clients who purchase EVs for commercial purposes.\n\nBecause many of Revfin's clients are first-time borrowers as well as first-time drivers, Aggarwal believes that #collaboration with other stakeholders in the EV ecosystem is critical to underwriting these borrowers.\n\nHe expects the company to generate half of its revenue from #b2b  customers over the next two to three years. Revfin's revenue was at Rs 37 crore in FY23, while it broke even on a profit after tax (PAT) basis, according to Aggarwal, who added that the company is at an annualised revenue run-rate of Rs 100 crore and expects to report Rs 80 crore in revenue in FY23, with roughly Rs 8 crore in PAT.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/fzpnPPW\n\n#revfin #fundingnews #startupindia #evfinancing #evlender #startup  #batteryfinancing #omidyarnetwork #evs #twowheelers #indianmarket #financing #batterycharging #EVecosystem #loancapital #deliveryservices RevFin Omidyar Network Payal Maini Naman M.

      "content": "🚖 Ever taken an Uber outside India?🌍\n\nI recently had the opportunity to experience Uber rides outside India. Let me tell you, the supply in India is very different. Here are a couple of key differentiators:\n\n🚗 The Car:\nIn India, a basic standard car is often a Dzire. If we’re lucky, we might get a WagonR, which has a peculiar smell and no boot space due to the CNG cylinder at the back. Compare this to other countries where you might get picked up in a Lexus, Skoda, or even a Tesla in Dubai! 🚙✨\n\n👨‍✈️ The Driver:\nIn India, it's common to enter the car while the driver is already on a phone call, not even bothering to get out of his seat. You're extremely lucky if they do. Outside India, drivers greet you, help with your luggage, and have a welcoming demeanor. 🌟😊\n\n🛣️ Road Network:\nWhile India’s road infrastructure is rapidly developing, it still lags behind many developed countries in terms of quality, safety, and technology integration. 🚧🏗️\n\nAt transferz, Heading supply in India, addressing the first two issues has been my north star metric. Here’s how we are making a difference:\n\n1. 👋 Driver Behavior:\n  - Implementing a basic greeting like, “How was your flight, Mr. Traveler?” can significantly enhance the traveler's experience. This simple gesture segues into more engaging conversations. 💬\n\n2. 🚘 The Car:\n  - Collaborating with fantastic companies in the EV space like Shoffr, OHM E Logistics, and Commutec Global. While these might be a tad expensive, the value they add is immense:\n   - Electric cars ensure a quiet ride with no CNG smell. 🔇🌿\n   - Sturdy and well-equipped for Indian roads. 🛡️🛤️\n   - Plenty of boot space. 🧳\n\nAdditionally, our easy-to-use ride management system at transferz ensures that trips are executed smoothly and conveniently. 📲✅\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, we’re not just providing a ride but an experience. 🌟\n\n#CustomerExperience #EV #Travel #Uber #Innovation #Transferz #India #GlobalStandards",

      "content": "Sometimes it feels like Kolkata has started to put the limelight on the startup space.\n\nBut truthfully, I really love it.\n\nIt's a proud moment for me that Kolkata's startup space is growing.\n\nBut why am I telling you this? \n\nBecause after the Jewelbox funding on Shark Tank India, there's another great news for the Kolkata startup ecosystem.\n\nLast week, our Kolkata-based EV ride-hailing platform Snap-E Cabs announced its $2.5M Pre-Series A funding round led by Inflection Point Ventures.\n\nKolkata-based Snap-E Cabs, a subsidiary of Steelman Telecom Pvt Ltd - a BSE listed company, was founded by MAYANK BINDAL and Jaydip Mukherjee in 2022.\n\nSnap-E is one of many companies in India operating EV cab fleets using a model similar to BluSmart.\n\nThey are currently operating with 600 EVs in Kolkata with an accounting rate of revenue of ₹350 million (~$4.2 million).\n\nSnap-E plans to expand its fleet by adding 300-400 EVs by the end of FY24.\n\nSnap-E achieved a GMV of INR 2.45 Cr in September '23 alone, contributing to a total GMV of INR 11 Cr over the past six months.\n\nSnap-E aims to deploy 2,000-3,000 more cars in Kolkata in the next 18-24 months.\n\nSnap-E utilizes a hybrid B2B and B2C model, allowing it to maintain less than a 5% downtime, ensuring a swift vehicle turnaround.\n\nThe startup plans to deploy the fresh proceeds for expansion, invest in technological enhancements, introduce new tech-enabled services, and scale up its operational footprint into additional regions.\n\nThe company is the biggest operator in eastern India, having the largest charging infrastructure, \n\nSnap-E Cabs is the only EV fleet operator to have signed an agreement with the Airports Authority of India, allowing it to operate from any Indian airport.\n\nEarlier this year, BluSmart, another Indian EV ride-hailing platform, received an investment of $25 million to reduce carbon emissions in Asia.\n\nPersonally, I find it very interesting that Steelman operates this EV fleet given that its core business is entirely unrelated (telecom implementation & engineering contract management).\n\nBut in the landscape of EV-only fleet startups currently, it looks like this:\n\nNCR, BLR - BluSmart ,Everest Fleet Pvt. Ltd. (Uber Green) \nHyderabad - OHM E Logistics.\nMumbai - Cab-E.\nKolkata - Snap-E Cabs.\nBangalore - Shoffr.\n\nNow, it's totally proved that India's ride-hailing industry is making progress in the electric vehicle (EV) sector.\n\nBest wishes to Team Snap-E Cabs for their upcoming future success.\n\nA few days ago, I had written about India's EV mobility revolution \"The future of EVs in India.\"\n\nDo check out the comment 👇😁\n\nRegards,\nFollow Subhrakanti for regular updates. ⚡",

      "content": "Uber just made a bold move in India—switching from a commission-based model to a subscription-based one for autos. This means drivers now pay a flat daily fee instead of Uber taking a cut from each ride.\n\nLet’s break it down! 👇\n\n1️⃣ Why Did Uber Make the Switch?\n💥 Market Disruption – ONDC-backed Namma Yatri charges zero commissions, forcing Uber to adapt.\n 💥 Growing Competition – Rapido, BluSmart (EVs), and Shoffr are eating into Uber’s market share.\n 💥 Government Push – The Indian government is promoting ONDC-based mobility, reducing dependence on private platforms.\n\n2️⃣ Impact on Uber’s Business\n💰 Before: Uber took 25% per ride (~₹250 on ₹1,000 earnings).\n💰 Now: Uber charges ₹20-₹40/day—a 90% revenue drop per driver!\n⚠️ Challenge: Uber needs 10x more active drivers just to break even.\n\n3️⃣ Impact on Consumers 🚀\n✅ Pros:\n ✔️ Lower fares – Drivers keep 100% of earnings.\n ✔️ Fewer cancellations – No profit-based refusals.\n ✔️ Transparent pricing – Govt-approved fares.\n ✔️ Happier drivers – More satisfied drivers = better service.\n\n❌ Cons & Risks:\n ⚠️ Uber = Just a tech platform? – Less involvement in ride economics, weaker customer support.\n ⚠️ Who ensures safety? – Uber invested in background checks, SOS, trip tracking—but will they still own rider safety?\n ⚠️ Less support & insurance – With Uber stepping back, trip insurance and dispute resolution could weaken.\n\n4️⃣ Uber’s Bigger Challenges in India & Beyond\n🇮🇳 India:\n 🚨 ONDC-backed ride-hailing threatens Uber’s dominance.\n ⚔️ Hyper-competitive market – Rapido (bikes), BluSmart (EVs) pulling premium users.\n 💵 Price-sensitive market – India = just 1% of Uber’s global revenue.\n\n🇺🇸 US:\n 🚖 Self-driving car disruption – Waymo surpassing Lyft in SF, reducing reliance on gig workers.\n ⚖️ Regulatory battles – Push for driver employee benefits = higher costs.\n 📉 Market saturation – Uber is profitable but future growth is uncertain.\n\n5️⃣ What’s Next for Uber India? 🚀\n💡 Hybrid model – Keep commissions for premium rides (Uber Premier, Uber XL), subscriptions for regular ones.\n 🛡️ Safety subscription – Charge for verified drivers, trip insurance, & 24/7 support.\n 🏛️ Govt-backed compliance – Work with regulators for driver verification & safety standards.\n\nIs this a game-changer or a desperate move? Do check Xplainerr newsletter (in the 1st comments) where Venkatesh Gupta has simplified this piece for you.\n\nBlog link - https://lnkd.in/eiQh5xqR\n\n#productmanagement #productmanager  #pminterview",

      "content": "Let’s talk about the ride-hailing market in India and why replicating Uber’s success here isn’t a smooth journey.  \n\nIn the US, Uber thrives on a Ride-sharing model with partners who are retirees or part-timers. They drive for fun, love meeting new people, and treat it as a side hustle. But here in India, it’s a whole different story. Most drivers depend entirely on this job as their primary source of income. They’re daily wage earners who work in shifts, either renting vehicles or driving for fleet owners. Their priority? Maximizing rides, not ride experience. \n\nNow add to this the reality of Price-sensitive Indian users. They don’t hesitate to switch platforms just to save a few bucks. This has turned the market into a commodity – everyone is offering the same ride, just with a slightly different price tag. No wonder Ola and Uber have seen a significant drop in market share as newer players like Rapido, Bluesmart, and others carve out niches like:  \n- BluSmart  Trained drivers, EVs.    \n- Shoffr  Premium rides.  \n- Nagara Meter Auto  Metered fare rides in Bangalore.  \n- QuicReach  Airport and Intercity Carpooling.  \n\nHere’s the kicker: Ola and Uber don’t control the driver supply. They’re matchmakers at best, connecting riders to drivers like OLX connects buyers to sellers. No control over the service = no quality consistency.  \n\nThe future? Sustainable businesses with strong USPs. Think of it like airlines – Indigo focuses on low costs, Vistara (now Air India) on premium service, and they coexist beautifully. The ride-hailing space is moving in the same direction. Businesses that focus on their strengths instead of burning millions to compete on price will win.  \n\nThis is where naviget comes in. 🚀  \n\nnaviget isn’t just another ride-hailing app – we’re here to redefine the game. For riders, we simplify commuting by offering transparency and ease. For businesses, we provide a platform that eliminates the heavy lifting of user acquisition, retention, and user-side tech management. Now, businesses can focus on what they do best – building their own USPs – while naviget connects them to a larger audience.  \n\nThe market is shifting, and we’re not just keeping up; we’re leading the way. Let’s make commuting smarter, better, and more sustainable.\n\n#ondc #ridehailing #oji #naviget \n\n Harry Campbell Yash Garg Satya Arikutharam Niranjanaradhya N Shubham Jain Anand Kumar",

The booking process was easy, the details were provided in time, Sanju was going to pick me up, he coordinated well after I landed and came just in time for my arrival without unnecessary calls. He helped me with my luggage and as I sat in the car, he informed me there was water, newspaper, tissues and some candies incase I needed, adjusted the ac to my preference , informed it would take about 1.5 hours to reach home and started. The journey was smooth to say the least, no unnecessary phone calls during the entire ride (unlike almost every taxi in bangalore) , the ride felt comfortable and safe. \nHe dropped us home in time. \n\nLater in the evening I realised, one of my earrings was missing, I looked around and couldn’t find it. I called Sanju , he immediately answered and said, I have it and I am on my way to deposit it at our hub. You can collect it from there. I couldn’t believe it could be so easy. The earring I lost, is a family heirloom, thus I wanted to be 100% certain and so I called another number where Shreyas assisted me, asked me for the details and said sure, we’ll hand it over to your husband on his upcoming trip tomorrow. \nI am still surprised , I found it so easily!\n\nIn a world full of chatbots, it’s nice to hear a human reply, that too a kind a reassuring one.\n\nThis was just my 2nd Shoffr ride :) \n\nThank you, team Shoffr!",

The merger finally happened on the 12th, so thought of penning down this one.\n\nHaving missed the golden era of Kingfisher and Jet Airways (Air India ka toh kya hi bole), I had no real benchmark for a full-service carrier. \n\nThings changed when I got an Axis Vistara Infinite card. \nStarted with a simple 'first-year fee reversal' offer to get that free business class voucher and ended up getting the Gold tier status without complex conditions. \nNo minimum spends, no number of flight criteria - amazing treatment whether I was flying economy or business.\n\nUnlike other premium cards (trust me, I've had my share), I don't think, it was because of Axis. Must be all Vistara. \n(kept on recommending it alongside Apple  ASICS  and Shoffr)\n\nImagine: \nDigiYatra for airport entry.\nPriority check-in & boarding (who loves long queues? No one), and extra baggage allowance that saved wifey's wedding wardrobe choices more than once. Aur kya chahiye, bhai!!\n\nTo whoever designed that loyalty program - you did a fab fab job. :)\n\nI used to think flying was just about getting from point A to B. \nThe cabin didn't matter until that free business class voucher changed everything. \nWalking through a dedicated airport gate and security clearance with hardly any queues. \nHaving binged enough Viral Bhayani videos, it felt like a celebrity without the paparazzi! ha..ha..\n\nI do believe, an iPhone and Business Class (on domestic routes) are the greatest equalizers. \nMay sound superficial, but what else enables access to people on either side of the spectrum? Home, cars, hotels, watches, shoes, wardrobe... Nop. Nothing.\n\nBack to flying. Two things blew my mind:\n1). How did they serve such amazing meals in the sky? Where did that entire cabin pressure and temperature difference things go! \n2). And those A321 Neo flat beds? 30,000 feet pe mast khana, Koffee with Karan aur uske baad power nap. Majja ni life. 🧿🧿🧿\n\nAs Vistara's wings merge with Air India, hope they don't just combine two airlines, but create something that sets new benchmarks in Indian (and I do hope, world) aviation. \n\nBecause sometimes, \nthe best way to honour a legacy is to build something even better. :)\n\nTo everyone who worked there, hope you folks had as equally great time and fun building and working together.\n\nUntil we meet again, at 30,000 feet! ✈️\nCheers. :)\n\n#CX #aviation",

Then there are also up-class players like BluSmart and Shoffr\n\n> And then there is Rapido, which has also started to offer cabs in select markets like Bengaluru and Gurgaon (I personally used it in Gurgaon- Super smooth experience)\n\nAnd all of this is naturally driving up the demand for drivers.\n\n..\n\nAnd the perks under Uber Pro help with reducing the potential churn of drivers active on Uber to other platforms.\n\nBasically, it gives the drivers more reasons to stick to Uber.\n\n..\n\nTo never miss such insights, join my 16k+ member \"Biz New+\" WA community: https://lnkd.in/dCKBXxsZ\n\n#LIPostingChallengeIndia #Uber #UberIndia #Fintech #DigitalLoans",

A: Schofer is a premium ride-hailing service aiming to set the gold standard in the industry.Success in this space isn't about scaling rapidly but doing so sustainably.

The silent ignition and the economic model, with running costs 90% cheaper than traditional vehicles, highlighted the potential of EVs for commercial use.\n  \n👏 Shoutout to the GrowthX team!

And I believe many other users face this too.\n\nWe often think of user platforms in terms of 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 or 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀, but 𝘀𝗮𝗳𝗲𝘁𝘆 must be at the core.\n\nIf the vehicle that shows up is 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗽𝗽, who is accountable if something goes wrong?\n\nHere are some key questions we should all be asking:\n\n✅ 𝘐𝘯 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘮 𝘰𝘳 𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘤𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘳 (𝘳𝘦𝘨𝘢𝘳𝘥𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳), 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘵𝘢𝘬𝘦𝘴 𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘱𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘺 — 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮 𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘥𝘳𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳?\n✅ 𝘐𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦’𝘴 𝘢𝘯 𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘥𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘪𝘯𝘫𝘶𝘳𝘺 𝘰𝘳 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘥𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘩, 𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘭𝘦 𝘪𝘵 𝘪𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘳𝘦𝘨𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘷𝘦𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘭𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘴𝘯’𝘵 𝘪𝘯𝘷𝘰𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘥?\n✅ 𝘏𝘰𝘸 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘤𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘳𝘴 𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘰𝘳 𝘳𝘦𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘴 𝘪𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘢𝘭 𝘥𝘳𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘢𝘴𝘯’𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘨𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘱𝘱?\n✅ 𝘊𝘢𝘯 𝘭𝘢𝘸 𝘦𝘯𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘤𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮’𝘴 𝘴𝘶𝘱𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵 𝘵𝘦𝘢𝘮 𝘢𝘤𝘵 𝘲𝘶𝘪𝘤𝘬𝘭𝘺 𝘪𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘷𝘦𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘭𝘦 𝘥𝘦𝘵𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘴 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘨𝘦𝘥?\n\nSure, Rapido can easily say: “𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗳𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀𝗻’𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵.”\n\nBut let’s be honest — if I’ve been waiting 10–15 minutes and I have an urgent meeting, interview, or need to mark office attendance, I won’t be in a position to cancel and rebook. That delay can cost me much more.\n\n𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁?

They also raised about $1M in a very innovative way, where all of their investors are their customers. This is probably the first time something like this happened in India.\n\nAlso, Vikas, as promised, I did try Shoffr, and it was a delight.

While online cab services were already available in Bangalore, what set Shoffr apart was its commitment to clean, comfortable cars, professional drivers, and no-cancellation rides. Gone are the days of early morning anxieties about Uber or Ola availability, extra charges, or last-minute cash payments. Shoffr has truly addressed these concerns. \n\nExcitingly, Shoffr is expanding its services to include outstation trips of up to 400kms. This new development raises curiosity about the reliability of this offering, especially considering past experiences with other ride-hailing services falling short in this particular segment.",

      "content": "If you are in Bangalore, you would have seen cars around reading Uber Black. Uber Black is Uber's luxury ride service in India that matches riders with top-rated drivers in #premium cars.\n\nBack in 2013, Uber launched Uber black offering ride services in premium cars from BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. In 2024, it relaunched Uber Black which consists of SUVs from Toyota and MG.\n\nA lot of this is due to the rise of incumbent #startups like Shoffr, BluSmart Premium. Here are some interesting numbers:\n\n- India's ride-hailing market is ~$7-12B, with airport travel $1-2 B and corporate travel another $2 B of this pie.\n\n- Bangalore's airport transfer #market ~Rs 1500 Cr with over 30,000 trips every day\n\n- The entire ride-hailing market is concentrated in top 10 tier cities in India\n\nOla, Uber disrupted the Taxi market with the DCO model( Driver Cum Owner). However, as most of us had encountered rising commissions and shrinking margins for drivers, #customerservice went for a toss due to high cancellations, extra charges, and trip denials.\n\nThe airport transfer and #corporate travel markets had always been comfort-first, and price-inelastic. That's where BluSmart and Shoffr came in with a new model in which they owned the vehicle and enhanced the customer experience. \n\nSince these are EV cabs, operating costs are lower. Companies have leveraged these savings to enhance customer experience. Uber Black is offered by Uber’s fleet partners, Everest Fleet taking complete ownership of the ride and not a DCO (driver cum owner) model like the regular Uber.\n\nUber India describes this as the “ #business class of back seats,” with features like a “quiet mode” option, temperature control, and more, all accessible from your mobile phone.\n\nIt's so interesting to see a company as big as Uber listening to on-ground feedback and launching services. Going ahead it's definitely going to eat into Shoffr and Blu Smart's market share.\n\nFor the sector, it's finally moving back from the marketplace model to the owned/ managed fleet model which existed since so many years. \n\nWith this shift back to a fleet-owned model, do you think ride-hailing services will improve in #india? Or will new challenges arise?\n\n#kneeledge",

      "content": "The recent buzz around BluSmart's operational pause has sparked a lot of discussion, and rightly so. Their commitment to service quality undeniably set a benchmark when compared to Ola and Uber. However, we need to consider the sustainability of a business model solely focused on superior service without a clear path to profitability.\n\nBluSmart's ability to offer premium service at comparable prices raises a crucial question: was this achieved by prioritizing user acquisition and satisfaction over long-term financial viability? The market dynamics suggest that while consumers appreciate quality, price sensitivity remains a significant factor. We can also see this with players like Shoffr, who, despite a reputation for excellent service, haven't been able to penetrate the intra-city cab market, due to their premium pricing.\n\nThis brings us to a fundamental lesson: exceptional service comes at a cost. As consumers, we must recognize that consistently demanding premium experiences at the lowest possible price can inadvertently lead to the demise of businesses striving for higher standards. Are we, as a market, willing to pay a reasonable premium for reliable and quality services, or will we continue to gravitate solely towards the cheapest option, potentially sacrificing service quality in the long run? Is this what has left us stuck with IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd)?\n\nP.S. My sincere empathy goes out to Punit K Goyal. It's disheartening to witness a fantastic founder potentially bearing the brunt of misaligned priorities of his partners. I hope he bounces back and continues to build impactful solutions elsewhere.\n\n#ElectricVehicles #RideHailing #CustomerExperience #BusinessStrategy #Sustainability #India #StartupEcosystem #BluSmart #Ola #Uber #Shoffr",

      "content": "Week 26 of #TechNewsWithARA - Weekly news dump on Sundays, this week on Monday again, as I was travelling over the weekend (more on that in the next post). The idea is just to keep the top news relating to #ProductManagement and general #Technology.\n\n1. 𝐐𝐮𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐬 𝐚𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐞𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐞. Blinkit and Zepto have recently started selling apparel, footwear, and accessories on their platform. As someone who worked in return reduction for 2.5 years, I must say that fashion sees the highest percentage of returns and without the option of that customers will not order from the platform. The Q-comm platforms are experimenting both with regular pickup for returns and in-store returns in collaboration with the original merchant.\n\n2. 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 Amazon 𝐚𝐧𝐝 Flipkart 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐯𝐢𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐚𝐰𝐬. The main points in this are giving preference to specific sellers, prioritising certain listings, and steeply discounting products and in the process hurting competition. Both the platforms having \"preferred sellers\" meant that the sellers got warehousing and other services and minuscule costs, and their products were highlighted on top of the pages. Apart from this, Other problems listed by Competition Commission Of India have been deep discounting and exclusive product launches (mobile phones). \n\n3. OpenAI 𝐥𝐚𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐨1 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐩𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭. It breaks down big problems into small steps and attempting to identify when it gets one of those steps right or wrong. The model seems to be in a new, developmental phase right now, but has some decent promise. Again, I understand there are too many models at this point for a regular (individual) user to keep up, but that is not there market anyway.\n\n4. Uber 𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐢𝐬 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐢𝐧 𝐌𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐚𝐢. Well, with the rise of BluSmart and Shoffr it only makes sense. But very honestly, at least in Bangalore, I can still not imagine them to have AC always working, water bottles always present, and the drivers being civil unless they own the fleet like the other two companies do.\n\n5. In a news that makes me realise India's tech infra is a decade ahead of the world, Google 𝐖𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐫𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐚 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐈𝐃 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐔𝐒. Google says it’s working with partners to make digital IDs acceptable in more situations, such as car rentals, account recovery, identity verification, and for TSA requirements while travelling. DigiLocker in India has been doing for so many years and the US is already attempting it now with a private company spearheading it.",

And BluSmart earned something rare in this space—trust.\nClean cars, timely arrivals, and the kind of calm that made people (especially seniors) feel safe.\n\nSo when I read:\n\n“My parents don’t want a car or a driver. They say, ‘BluSmart hai na.’”\nAnd then—\n“‘Ab BluSmart nahi hai.’”\n\n…it hit deeper than just a business headline.\n\nBecause at its core, mobility isn’t about tech, cars, or convenience.\nIt’s about care.\nIt’s about people trusting that someone will show up without fail.\n\nAnd when that trust breaks because of investigations or mismanagement—someone needs to show up in its place. Not to compete, but to serve.\n\nI saw Kislay Verma from Shoffr respond to a concerned user with this line:\n\n“We’d be honoured to serve your parents.”\nNo pitch. Just empathy. That’s the energy this space needs more of.\n\nAt Drive Assist, we’re trying to build with the same intention.\nWe’re offering drivers on demand and permanent drivers, yes.\nBut more than that, we’re building human-first mobility—the kind that doesn’t just move people, it supports them.\n\nBecause: ✅ Trust is earned, not claimed.\n✅ Good service is quiet, consistent, and caring.\n✅ And people always remember how you made them feel.\n\nTo everyone wondering what comes after BluSmart—there are alternatives being built.\nNot just louder. Better.\n\nLet’s build a mobility ecosystem where trust isn’t a feature.\nIt’s the default.",

Their journey is a proof that: Success isn't about where you start - it's about how passionately you innovate.\n\nFrom small beginnings with batteries for mobile devices and laptops - they set their sights on to the automotive world - an area they had no prior experience in. Yet, in just a few years, they have surpassed Tesla in sales to become one of the largest EV maker. How?\n\n🔋 Mastering the toughest part first - They began with batteries, the heart of EVs, long before entering into cars.\n\n🚀 Innovate at the core and basics - Their blade battery technology in front of normal lithium ion batteries solved major EV concerns on safety ,efficiency and longevity. This build the trust among the customers.\n\n🌍 Mass adoption over luxury - While Tesla focused on premium EVs, BYD prioritized affordability and public transport solutions, making electric mobility accessible to the masses. Today, BYD taxis dominate streets in Thailand, and their partnership with Bengaluru-based taxi startup Shoffr hints an expansion into India.\n\nThe big question for EV enthusiasts : Will BYD reshape Indian roads and challenge local giants like Tata and Mahindra? Or their growth will be restricted due to geopoltical reasons? 🤔 \n\nThe future of EVs isn’t just about who starts first—it’s about who scales smarter. Start small, master your expertise, and build an empire!!\n\n#EVRevolution #BYD #Innovation #SustainableFuture #ElectricVehicles #AutomotiveLeadership #BuildYourDreams #SuccessMindset #Motivation #Shoffr",

Is it the real truth?\n\nI have seen more people having AirPods Max at Tier 1 cities India airports and gyms then Frankfurt airport. \n\nI think it's more to do with the cost to gain ration or simply the ROI. Here ROI can refer to not just fulfilling the core use case value but emotional values too.\n\nIndian customers are very smart with buying, they will check the reviews especially the bad ones and research properly when it comes to buying their wants.\n\nDon't fool them with false or vague narratives, it can help you to trick them once but they will return back as an army of detractors to bring you down.\n\nI think in the end it's about setting the right balance of perceived and actual value of your product/service.\n\nShoffr is one good example, haven't used it but have heard a lot of good things about it.\n\nSo yes Indians do pay if you provide the right value :)",

For a year or two now, they have been the poster boys of how to build a EV startup and create customer love. However, all that seems like hogwash.\n\nThe founders, Anmol and Puneet Jaggi raised 977 Cr, intended for purchasing EV's and diverted 250+ Cr through a car dealer. Instead, only 4,704 EVs were acquired, leaving significant funds unaccounted for.\n\n- 42+ crores were diverted to buy a luxury apartment in the DLF Camillas, Gurgaon\n- 6.2 Cr to his mother\n- 2.98 Cr to his wife\n- 1.8 Cr in foreign currency\n- 26 L in golf kits\n\nThis is a systemic fraud, one that will hurt the Indian startup scene badly. This saga underscores the risks of poor corporate governance; investors would do well to prioritize transparency and accountability to safeguard trust.\n\nFor those who will miss BluSmart, might I recommend using Shoffr.",

Founded by Vikas Bardia, CFA and Kislay Verma in 2022, Shoffr is here to redefine your ride experience with guaranteed bookings, luxurious SUVs, and drivers who actually care about your time.\n\n#Pros:\n\t•\tGuaranteed rides—no cancellations or last-minute surprises.\n\t•\tSpacious, luxury electric SUVs that are eco-friendly.\n\t•\tCourteous, professional drivers who value your time and don’t mind waiting 10–15 minutes if needed (unlike Uber where drivers cancel in frustration).\n\n#Cons:\n\t•\tA bit on the expensive side. But yes, luxury and comfort come with a price tag!! \n\nMy Experience:\n\nI booked Shoffr for an early morning airport transfer (you know how stressful those can be). The driver arrived 10 minutes early, the ride was smooth, and for once, I actually enjoyed my commute! Knowing the driver wouldn’t cancel or rush me made all the difference. Sure, it’s pricier than a regular cab, but honestly, the experience felt worth it.\n\nAnd guess what? They even keep water and candies to bring a little smile to your face. It’s those small touches that make Shoffr more than just a ride—it’s an experience.\n\nIf you’re in Bengaluru and looking for reliable, premium transport, give Shoffr a shot. Whether it’s a one-time splurge or your go-to ride, it’s bound to impress!! \n\nP.S. This isn’t a paid promotion—just sharing something I genuinely enjoyed!\n\n#ShoffrStories #LuxuryCommutes #BengaluruDiaries",

But instead of trying to win over the whole market, they built something exceptional for a small group of frequent flyers who just wanted reliable, comfortable airport transfers.\nThis wasn’t just a niche. It was their minimum viable segment, the ideal starting point for their MVP.\n\nThat tight focus paid off. Shoffr hit $1.5 million in ARR and turned profitable, all with just 75 EVs and less than ₹50 lakh in equity.\nSince then, they’ve expanded into hourly rentals and are slowly entering new markets like Delhi NCR.\n\nBut the real validation came in March 2024, when Shoffr raised $1.1 million from their own customers. No VCs. Just pure user love. Over 100 people invested, and nearly a third were startup founders.\nThat kind of trust doesn’t come from being good enough. It comes from building something people genuinely care about.\n\nShoffr didn’t chase mass appeal. They solved one problem incredibly well. And when it mattered most, their users backed them not just with bookings, but with belief.\n\nThat’s Brian Chesky’s quote, lived out in full.",

Lots of digital stalking later, I was left with a smile with stories from Shoffr users and the unconventional rooted approach of the founders and with that extra heartbeat of hope only Bengaluru-eans get when they discover a reliable, comfortable option (especially for their airport escapades). \n\nSo, here is my take on the Power of Storytelling apt for a business like Shoffr (they already seem to be resonant with it) that is focused on solid value-driven growth permeating from founders to chauffeurs to users:\n\n“Today I got a chance to be a part of someone’s experience - one that they will remember for their life. A pregnant woman, a baby that decided to meet his/her parents earlier than they expected, the Bengaluru thunderstorm, the father stuck in traffic, and an hourly rental booking on Shoffr (made in absolute confidence by him). A 3 km ride from the parents’ home to the hospital, reminding the mother to breathe and to sip on water through the ride, ensuring her a smooth travel to eventually being hugged by the teary-eyed father” \n~ Samundra, Shoffr at Shoffr\n(Focus on gold standard experience through excellent service + building human connections)\n\nRead the full piece on my Substack here: https://lnkd.in/guwh2GJh\n\nShoffr Vikas Bardia, CFA Kislay Verma\n\nFor more such Founder and Brand Storytelling Services, feel free to DM!",

It was a poor experience and as soon as I reached Jaipur, I saw an article and suddenly it all made sense.\n\nBluSmart is facing a major leadership crisis - CEO Anirudh Arun, CTO Rishabh Sood, Chief Business Officer Tushar Garg, and VP of Experience Priya Chakravarthy have all resigned in the past week. This exodus comes amid serious financial troubles, with their parent company Gensol Engineering selling off 34% of BluSmart’s fleet (about 3,000 EVs) to manage mounting debt.\n\nThe company that once promised to revolutionize ride-hailing with clean EVs and professional service is now seeing daily rides drop to less than half what they were previously clocking. Their Dubai operations are being shut down as they scramble to stay afloat.\n\nWhat’s particularly telling is how these corporate troubles directly translate to the declining customer experience I felt firsthand. Without proper maintenance budgets, the cars are deteriorating. Without leadership oversight, service standards are collapsing.\n\nI believe this is the end of a beloved company which couldn’t scale. Their asset-heavy model that required owning both vehicles and charging infrastructure proved too capital-intensive, and now they’re paying the price for rapid expansion without sustainable unit economics.\n\nCurious to see what kind of new companies arise here - major opportunity. Already rooting for Shoffr.\n\n#MobilityDisruption #StartupLessons #CustomerExperience",

Bought the ticket (yes yes!)\n2. Bought HDFC Bank stocks (smart move, right?)\n3. Thought about how the larger industry could benefit from these concerts\n\n\"Do you know\"  Experiences are now the growth engine of travel, predicted to hit nearly ~$300 billion by 2025 globally (Skift), especially amongst millennials - the largest traveler segment? \n\nDiljit's US tour alone raked in $28 million in sales, with some reselling for as high as 56 lakhs INR? 🤯 Insane right? \n\nThis brings me to his sold-out Delhi concert planned next month. With ~50K attendees coming from different locations across Delhi NCR, imagine the chaos for transport, demand for alternate accommodations, and of course food and drinks! Could this be an opportunity for brands to position them uniquely and build organic connections with Diljit's fanbase, who are both loyal and premium? Absolutely!\n\nA couple of ideas that brands can explore (Think of it as \"TAP\" framework :D)\n\n1.Transport: Provide comfortable and convenient pick-up/drop services across Delhi NCR. This ensures fans enjoy the show without travel worries, while your brand becomes synonymous with a smooth and enjoyable journey.\n\n2. Accommodation: Help fans party like a \"Proper Patola\" by offering concert + stay packages at nearby hotels/serviced apartments. This not only provides convenience but also allows you to curate a memorable experience with themed rooms, or maybe a \"Patiala Peg\" welcome drink :D\n\n3. Partnerships: Food is core to Delhites. Can food delivery platforms or restaurants create a virtual \"Diljit's Dhaba\" with iconic Punjabi cuisines. A super cool way to engage fans emotionally. \n\nOffer exclusive discounts for concert-goers and your loyalty program members. Even at a conservative 15-20% conversion rate, ~2-2.5K AOV, thats 2 crores+ on GBV. And this is just ONE of his 10 planned India concerts! \n\nThe modern traveler is collecting stories, not souvenirs. Experiences are the new currency of travel (okay, this is OG :D)\n\nShare this with brands who could leverage such opportunities 🙂  \n\nZomato Swiggy Zepto magicpin BluSmart Savaari Car Rentals Avis India Ola Uber Shoffr Bloom OYO Booking.com Airbnb MakeMyTrip redBus Hilton The Lodhi New Delhi The Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) Radisson Hotel Group Hyatt Hotels Corporation GetYourGuide\n\n#DiljitDosanjh #hdfc #travel #hospitality #marketing #concert #india #google #experiences #tickets #sales #opportunity",

Same ride, same time, but ₹100 more on an iPhone than Android? Uber thinks iOS users pay for the experience.\n\n🔄 Driver Cancels, You Suffer. \"5 mins away\" turns into \"Sorry, not going your way.\" Repeat cycle. 🙃\n\n🚗 Cabs Nearby? Just for Show. Those tiny cab icons dancing around my location give hope, but somehow I’m matched with a driver 20 mins away. What's the point of the map, then - emotional support? 🗺️\n\n🤦‍♂️ UI = Unintended Irritation. Can’t edit location, can’t find Uber Premier or Go, but hey, they push Uber Moto like my life depends on it. 🛵\n\nNow, think of a few moonshot (but doable) ideas for Uber:\n💡 Real-time cab availability heatmaps before booking\n💡 Automatic fallback to nearest category if no cabs are available (e.g., switch from Black to Premier)\n💡 Verified zones where drivers actually go (filter out the “Not going there” drama)\n💡 Live driver intent tracking - know upfront if a driver is likely to cancel based on past behaviour & trip acceptance patterns\n\nWith BluSmart shutting down and Shoffr stepping in, there’s competition - but not the kind that lets Uber stay comfy. \nShoffr’s already offering a better experience, and Uber finally took a hint by relaunching Uber Black (finally). 🖤\nTime to move from 𝙢𝙖𝙧𝙠𝙚𝙩 𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙚𝙧 to 𝙚𝙭𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙚𝙧.

      "content": "🚨#NewBusinessModel Alert!!!🚨\n\nWith Blusmart out indefinitely, there's now an emerging new model that Ola and Rapido drivers have picked up - converting premium rides to shared rides, and at the exact same charges. \n\nThis seems to be the NEW \"Payment cash, Sir?\" anecdote that is conveniently being added to all such rides now.\n\nGot to experience it first hand yesterday and then today again! Kudos to the Jugaad culture. \n\nBut what about the Indian consumer who is caught offguard amidst all such innovative business models? Well, in a country where consumer rights & convenience are treated just as seriously as the poll promises of our favorite politicians, you get all of these at no extra charge:\n\n- **Money stuck in BluSmart subscriptions**: A quarterly/annual package that gets stuck and there are ZERO grace periods/days added. Oh and yes, they won't accept rides, but they'll gladly accept additions to your wallet. #CustomerObsession anyone?\n\n- **Infinite Tips**: There's really no limit to the tip amount across Ola and Rapido. And it needs to be paid upfront, so that the driver can choose you over another hapless soul. Yeah, finally Money can buy you happiness!\n\n- **Start your day learning new abusive words**: Especially if your driver speaks in a local language that you are still learning, and you somehow land in a conversation that he dislikes. He will abandon the fluent English/Hindi at the drop of a hat and help you learn new words in the local language ever so gracefully. Feel left out? Here's your word of the day - Naayi! (learnt it the other day, when I pointed out that the driver had taken a wrong turn)\n\n- **Experiencing the thrill of a roller coaster at no extra charges**: Be it running the car in an opposite direction on a one-way road, the potholes and speed breakers that are meant to be conquered, or the sudden 90 degree turns out of nowhere, who says you need to visit an Essel World or a Wonderla to enjoy such thrill?! The older BluSmart (not the late 2024-25 avatar of it) and Shoffr seem to be exceptions here, but those seem to be tailored towards a more boring populace, and not the thrill seeking maniacs like us!\n\n#ApdaMeAvsar #IndianConsumerStories",

Shoffr has been creating noise in the cab industry with being one of the few services focusing on a high quality user experience with in cab rentals in Bangalore alongside BluSmart by focusing on driver behaviour and car fleet quality, as opposed to the other standard apps. This removal on KMs cap is such a welcome change which hopefully will see the same experience from #UberBlack.",

Read the Market Right :\nRapido noticed that two-wheelers were king in India, especially in smaller cities.\nOla and Uber missed this, so Rapido seized the chance to serve an untapped market with cheaper, quicker rides.\n\n2. Kept Costs Low :\nWith bikes, costs stayed lean—letting Rapido keep prices low for users in low-income areas.\nThat made it a no-brainer choice for people who wanted value for money.\n\n3. Put Drivers First :\nWhile others took hefty cuts, Rapido prioritized its drivers, offering better pay, faster payouts, and extra income options.\nThis approach built loyalty—drivers trusted Rapido more and stayed with them.\n\n4. Flexible Fees :\nRapido’s fixed-fee model was a game-changer. It gave drivers stable, predictable earnings, drawing more of them to the platform.\n\n5. Expanded to Deliveries :\nBy adding delivery services in non-peak hours, Rapido tapped into new revenue streams with the same fleet—doubling down on efficiency when they partnered with Swiggy and explored logistics in quick commerce.\n\n6. Tier-2 and Tier-3 Focus :\nRapido didn’t need to fight big brands like ola and uber in major cities. Instead, it grew in smaller cities with less competition and less ad spend.\n___________________________________________________________________\nWhat’s Next?\n\nRapido's growth is impressive, but it still faces challenges like regulatory hurdles and scaling without losing driver and customer trust.\n\nWell now… even Ola and Uber are into Bikes, Parcel delivery, sharing Auto and Cabs along with BluSmart, Shoffr, Zypp Electric,Yulu etc.\n\nThe Chase is on!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#RapidoSuccess #StartupStrategy #MarketAdaptation #RideHailingInnovation #DriverFirst #Tier2Growth #IndianMarket #AffordableRides #TechForGood #BusinessGrowth #CustomerFocus\n#MarketDisruption",

We try harder.\" was a #marketing masterstroke launched in 1962, crafted by the advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB). \n\nAt the time, Avis was the second-largest car rental company in the U.S., trailing behind Hertz, the industry leader. Rather than shying away from their underdog status, Avis embraced it, turning their position into a strength. \n\nThe campaign was rooted in the idea that being number two meant Avis had to go the extra mile to win customers - through better service, harder work, and more dedication.\n\nThe tagline came out of a meeting where DDB’s creative team, led by Helmut Krone and Bill Bernbach, pushed for honesty over exaggeration. Avis president Robert Townsend reportedly shared candid insights about the company’s operations, revealing a culture of scrappy determination. \n\nThis inspired the campaign’s core message:\n\nAvis wasn’t the biggest, but they’d outwork the competition to earn your business. The ads were straightforward, witty, and human - promising things like faster service, and cars in top condition.\n\nThe campaign was a massive success. Within a year, Avis went from losing $3.2 million to turning a $1.2 million profit. By 1966, their market share jumped from 11% to 16%, closing the gap with Hertz. The tagline became a cultural touchstone, resonating beyond advertising as a mantra for underdogs everywhere. It ran for 50 years until Avis retired it in 2012 for a new campaign, “It’s Your Space,” which focused on empowering customers. However, the “We Try Harder” ethos remains a defining part of Avis’s brand identity.\n\nVikas is building almost silently. Shoffr cabs 🚖 are BYD E6 in top condition, The liveried chauffeurs are well-spoken, well-mannered and the service is top notch. \n\nAn airport ride with Rishi this morning, and his gleaming luxury car is one experience I'd like to repeat more often, at every possible opportunity. \n\nMy very best wishes, Vikas. We need to meet when I am in your city the next time. Your \"build\" story in the turbulent time would be compelling, for sure. Cheers ☕️!",

While ride-sharing services provide convenience to passengers, they also bring irresponsible parking, rash driving, and a lack of respect towards local authorities and panchayat workers.\n🚧 Key Concerns:\n 🔹 Road Safety – Speeding and reckless driving pose risks to both villagers and pedestrians.\n 🗑 Cleanliness – Drivers often litter, ignoring waste management efforts by the local community.\n 🤝 Respect – Many drivers fail to acknowledge or cooperate with panchayat workers and native villagers.\nWe welcome ride-hailing services but urge them to operate responsibly and respectfully. Local communities are not just transit zones—they are homes to people who care about safety, cleanliness, and harmony.\nA request to BluSmart, QuickRide, and Airport Taxi Operators:\n 📢 Please educate and train drivers to be mindful of their surroundings.\n 📢 Implement strict parking regulations and enforce discipline.\n 📢 Promote mutual respect between drivers and native villagers.\nLet's work towards a smoother, safer, and more responsible ride-sharing ecosystem.

Shoffr did neither. Instead, they asked:\n\n→ What if we solved problems others overlooked?\n→ What if we focused on the right audience instead of serving everyone?\n\nHere’s what they did differently:\n1.⁠ ⁠They chose their audience wisely. High-end users—busy professionals, corporate clients, and frequent travellers who value chauffeur-driven convenience.\n2.⁠ ⁠They didn’t just offer rides; they offered experiences. Luxury vehicles, top-notch service, and unmatched reliability became their hallmark.\n3.⁠ ⁠They avoided competing and focused on solving. By partnering with corporates, event planners, and hotels, they became a trusted name in their niche.\n4.⁠ ⁠They grew through trust and excellence. Word-of-mouth and premium service turned their customers into loyal ambassadors.\n\n✨ Takeaway: Shoffr’s story is proof that you don’t need to compete with giants to win big. Smart segmentation, quality service, and solving specific pain points can take you to the top.\n\n📌P.S. What’s one “overlooked” problem in your industry that could be your breakthrough?

      "content": "A friend of mine recently shared her struggles with ride-hailing services; she often faced last-minute cancellations, especially during peak hours. Fortunately, the rise of electric vehicle (EV) cab companies like BluSmart, Quick Ride, Envi, and Shoffr signifies a transformative shift in our commuting experience.\n\nMany of us are willing to pay a little more for the peace of mind that comes with reliability. The operational model of EV services—where companies own the fleet—significantly reduces cancellation rates and allows drivers to focus on providing quality service without the stress of vehicle ownership.\n\nAdditionally, the eco-friendly aspect of these services resonates deeply with those of us who are conscious of our carbon footprint. By choosing EV cabs, we contribute to cleaner air in our city, aligning our transportation choices with our values.\n\nHowever, challenges remain. The shortage of vehicles during peak hours highlights the urgent need for further investment in EV infrastructure and fleet expansion. As demand for reliable, sustainable transportation continues to grow, so must the supply.\n\nLet’s continue to champion and support innovations that prioritize reliability and sustainability in our urban mobility solutions! \n\nRead more about the shift to electric cabs here: https://lnkd.in/gv5Xek2m",

      "content": "Seen a number of posts written as an ode to BluSmart, and how there’s now a void that needs to be filled. \n\nBut in my honest opinion, this void has been there for a long time now. The points of differentiation (PODs) that Blusmart brought to the market were mainly around:\n1. Confirmed, and ‘mostly’ on-time rides post reservation\n2. A subscription plan that fuelled the above and let you reserve in advance\n3. Respectful drivers (who won’t fight with you for turning the AC on, or be abusive)\n4. Drivers who won’t make you fear for your life with rash and irresponsible driving\n5. A customer support function that, well, ‘existed’\n6. EV cars, for those who care about the environment\n\nIf you objectively evaluate each of the above PODs, shouldn’t these be mere hygiene factors that everyone in the market should adhere to? If the dominant players in the market are not providing these basic service levels, then isn’t the void so glaringly obvious and one that has existed for eons now?\n\nAnd again, we know how Blusmart started struggling with points 1, 4, and 5 as the company scaled up its operations and added more cars. So they started contributing to this void much before their sad debacle. \n\nThe question is, with Shoffr already ticking the boxes on points 1, 3, 4, 5 (in passive form), and 6 above, how long will it take them to crack point number 2, and scale operations without compromising on each of these hygiene factors?\n\nAs someone who takes cabs at least 2-3 times a week, I would keenly be waiting for this next phase where there is an existing playbook that can be perfected (with some tweaks of course), but one with far reaching impact that could set the gold standard for this industry in times to come!\n\nPS: Still waiting for a refund on my subscription fees and wallet amount that's stuck with Blusmart. So here's another markdown for them on points 2 and 5!\n\n#blusmart #shoffr #cabs #businessmodels",

Over the last few rides, Shoffr has been a huge letdown. Despite booking well in advance, the cab is always late by 15-20 minutes, and customer service is nowhere to be found.\n\nToday, yet again, my 5:30 PM ride is delayed, reinforcing a trend I’ve seen over the last three bookings. The worst part? When things go wrong, Shoffr simply reassigns a cab at the last moment, offering zero accountability for the delay.\n\nOn Feb 4th, after facing a similar issue, I reached out directly to the founder, but I never got a response.\n\nShoffr do better. Reliable airport commutes are non-negotiable and scaling at the cost of customer service is not the way to go!\nVikas Bardia, CFA",

      "content": "Uber One: An experiment for dynamic priced mass-premium service for the value conscious Indian users\nThere's a lot of debate around 'value conscious' Indian customers, and to serve them better, Uber just launched a new subscription program called 'Uber One', a mass-premium service that is more nuanced than a direct premium service competitors like Shoffr.\n\nQuick overview of Uber one: It is offering up to 10% Uber one credits, prioirty support, zomato gold for 3 months, and top rated drivers!\n\nTo understand 'mass-premium', let's understand the user segment:\n- Frequent urban commuters who use Uber 3-4 times per week\n- Value-conscious professionals seeking predictable ride expenses\n- Cross-platform users who utilize both rides and food delivery services\n\nBut the most interesting thing is the subscription price: Uber introduced a dynamic city-based pricing that indicates market testing. What it means is there's a different price for difference city. For Kolkata, the subscription fee is around 99 rupees/month where as in delhi it is priced around 49 rupees/month\n\nNow Let's dig deep into this positioning to understand the intent behind 'Uber one'\n- Creating a middle-market loyalty program rather than competing with ultra-premium services\n- Focusing on increasing usage frequency and cross-platform adoption\n- Building an ecosystem play rather than a pure premium service offering\n- Targeting value-maximizing regular users rather than luxury-seeking customers\n\nBut why now? Let's understand how is Uber doing as a business? and we may get a clue!\n- Record-Breaking Growth\n- Uber achieved its first GAAP operating profit exceeding $1 billion\n- 20% year-over-year increase in gross bookings\n- 82% year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA to $1.4 billion\n\nThis seems the perfect timing, right? And on top of that:\n- 25 million Uber One members globally\n- Global Uber One members spend 3x more than non-members\n- 70% year-over-year growth in subscription base\n\nAnd even on top of that, the competition is on fire:\n- Rising competition from Google-backed Namma Yatri, which recently Secured $11 million in funding\n- Emergence of specialized players like Rapido, which recently achieved unicorn status with $120 million funding\n\nBut as any other experiment, it has a room for improvement. Personally I would recommend:\n- Pricing Strategy: Implement consistent pricing across cities to reduce confusion. Create tier-based subscription levels based on usage patterns. Offer flexible subscription periods beyond current monthly/annual options\n- Product Enhancement: . Introduce city-specific benefits for different city-wise user segment rather than one-size-fits-all approach",

By deliberately avoiding the “growth at all costs” trap, they built a model that’s lean, resilient, and deeply customer-focused.\n\nHere’s what others can learn:\n🔸 Second-mover advantage isn’t a weakness—it's strategic. Shoffr studied early players, sidestepped their mistakes, and implemented better systems.\n🔸 Quality > speed. They chose the right EV fleet and matched demand smartly, ensuring every ride added value.\n🔸 Durability matters. In operations-heavy businesses, stability and long-term trust beat flashy short-term wins.\n\nShoffr’s story reminds founders that it’s okay to grow slow—if you're growing smart.\n\n#StartupLessons #Shoffr #FoundersWisdom #SmartScaling #SecondMoverAdvantage #MobilityIndia #BuildToLast",

But who's actually practicing it?\n\nAcross Indian consumer businesses - from D2C startups to legacy conglomerates - customer experience remains more of a checklist item than a core strategy. Case in point - AI chatbots are now everywhere, but how many actually solve your problems?\n\nDelay in delivery? No refund path!\nGeneric responses? No auto escalation flow! \nAs consumers, all we get is just a frustrating, circular bot loop.\n\nSlightly dated, but a 2023 Capgemini report showed:\n🔹 68% of Indian consumers had poor digital experiences in the past 6 months\n🔹 Only 8% ever escalate, due to how broken and slow consumer redressal remains\nI'm sure this difference would be even more staggering in 2025, with the rampant rat race to adopt AI, without deliberating on the core tenets.\n\nDespite all the MBA talk of “working backwards from the customer”, the same MBA grads often end up sidelining customer centricity in their corporate roles. For every Shoffr that gets it right, 100 others scale despite bad service.\n\nWhat’s worse? Even global brands, known for customer obsession, often drop their standards in India, instead of raising the bar.\n\nWho holds them accountable? And when do we start rewarding long-term customer trust over short-term growth hacks?\n\nAI or no AI, India’s consumer story won’t reach its full potential until customer centricity becomes the strategy - not the afterthought.\n\n#CustomerExperience #CustomerObsession #EcommerceIndia #IndianStartups  \n#ConsumerBehavior #AICustomerSupport #RetailInIndia #LeadershipInAction  \n#ProductThinking #CustomerFirst #LinkedInVoices #BusinessStrategy #AIAutomation #ConversationalAI #Chatbots #TechInCX",

The drivers are polite, the EV rides are calm, and the whole experience—from the greeting to when you step out—feels seamless.\n\nHonestly, I’ve never had such peaceful airport rides.

The surge is fueled by app-based taxi services embracing electric mobility.\n\nLeading the charge is BluSmart, expanding to Mumbai on January 1, 2025, with other local players like Snap E in Kolkata, Shoffr in Bengaluru, GReL in Pune, GoEV in Tirupati, and GoGreen Cabs in Nashik following suit.\n\nUber, a key player, has introduced Uber Green in India, offering an EV-only option. Their strategy includes partnerships with fleet providers to deploy 25,000 EVs in seven major cities, collaborations for electric two-wheelers, and agreements for charging infrastructure development.\n\nIn the bike taxi segment, Uber and Rapido are gearing up to deploy electric two-wheelers. Uber is teaming up with Zypp Electric for over 1,000 electric two-wheelers in Delhi, while Rapido plans to launch an all-electric bike-taxi service in the city by 2025.\n\nDespite progress, challenges persist for the broader 4-wheeler EV market, including reduced government incentives, high acquisition costs, range anxiety, hybrid vehicle promotion by traditional manufacturers, and policy uncertainties.\n\nTo maximize the environmental benefits, stakeholders need to ensure that charging infrastructure relies on renewable energy sources. This eco-friendly approach enhances the green impact and supports environmental conservation. The growing EV ride-sharing market is poised to significantly drive India's EV adoption strategy, potentially aiding the country's aim of achieving 30% EV sales penetration by 2030.",

They promised comfort and amenities, but the only extras provided were a bottle of water and a newspaper from the previous day. Paying a 40% premium for an “all-electric” vehicle (the Chinese car BYD E6) that can’t stick to its schedule? I’m not convinced it’s worth it.\n\nIf you're thinking about using Shoffr for airport transfers, it's best to keep your expectations realistic!\n#shoffr #arnee",

With no Uber or Ola showing up, I was genuinely stuck.\n\nThat’s when a colleague recommended Shoffr, and within an hour, I was picked up in a sleek, premium EV—and the ride turned out to be far more than just a pickup.\n\n🔹 Spacious legroom\n🔹 Reading lights\n🔹 Huge sunroof\n🔹 Tissues, bottled water, clean interiors\n🔹 And surprisingly affordable pricing!\n\nThe driver even gave me a mini night tour of India Gate before dropping me at the airport. Smooth, clean, and completely stress-free.\n\n📸 Posting a picture of the EV below.\n📽️ Video of the ride coming up next!\n\n#Shoffr #EVExperience #TravelStory #GreenMobility #IndiaGate #DelhiNCR #LateNightRide #AffordableLuxury",

That’s why the \"CO2 emissions saved\" feature that Shoffr has, matters.\n\nI mean how are they even going to profit by showing us this information? It has nothing to do with UI or App’s offerings as well.\n\nBut, that’s what is great here.\n\nIt’s a small design element, but it’s powerful because it connects the app to a larger purpose\n\nSuch elements are key because they help brands CONNECT with users on a DEEPER LEVEL. When users feel a brand cares about more than just profit—whether it's the environment, community, or social impact—they're more likely to trust and stay loyal.\n\nIt also shouts SERVICE MINDSET. They want to show that Shoffr isn’t just about getting them from point A to point B—it’s about doing so in a way that benefits the planet, too. This feature is a perfect example of PURPOSE DRIVEN UX.\n\nSo, while it might not directly move the needle on profits, it plays a key role in how users connect with the app and what it represents.\n\nSmall details, big impact.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this!",

      "content": "So now you'd easily be able to spot flying taxis from your skyscrapers in Bengaluru.\n\nAlso, does it make sense?\n\nLet's look at the unit economics.\n\nDistance from e-city to airport is 55 kms, and it usually takes 2+ hours on any day with INR 1200+, in the range of 21/ km (Rapido/Ola/Uber w/o surge) to 26+/km (Shoffr/ Premium w/o surge)\n\nWith the aerial distance of 35-40 kms, and starting charge of INR 1700, it starts from 42/km. I doubt they'll charge 1700/- for e-city. This could be the starting price or an average price.\nIt's a 7-seater, so 1700*7= ~ 12k per trip.\nAssuming 19 minutes is the trip with no stoppages, and 10-11 minutes of dropping and picking, we can safely assume 3 one-way trips every 2 hours.\n\nDaily max. capacity: Terminal 1 - 70k, Terminal 2 - 40k\nAssuming at least 2000 passengers, hit on a hourly basis, and 8-10% can try the flying-taxis based on distance, urgency and luggage restrictions, means for 150-200 folks, you'll see at least 10 flying taxis every hour.\n\nNot bad, this can go upto 20 or 30 as well depending on the air traffic congestion and new policies for them.\n\nComing back to unit economics, for 20 taxis every hour, daily generation of revenue 12k per trip * 1.5 trips/hour * 12 hours= ~ 2.2 lacs per day, or at least 800 Cr annually.\n\nDepending on the pilot salaries, operational expenses, airport parking & pick-up location charges, maintenance and miscellaneous, this should be recovered in 2 years if not in 1.\n\nI'm not sure how it is going to turn out environmentally, but for sure the airport surge charges are going to reduce with the air competition for airport rides.\n\nThoughts?\n\n#bengaluru #flying_taxis",

      "content": "For those of us navigating Bangalore’s traffic, finding a reliable ride-hailing service that genuinely prioritizes customer care has been a constant struggle. In a market dominated by Olas and Ubers, BLUSMART did set itself apart with clean cars, courteous drivers, and stellar customer service. Sadly, they've shut shop, leaving behind a void that many startups are now trying to fill—though not quite to the same standard.  \n\nShoffr has been a promising alternative, but with its current limited fleet size, availability remains a challenge. \n\nQuickRide, on the other hand, has been an incredibly frustrating experience—long wait times, last-minute ride cancellations, and an unresponsive customer support team. What’s worse? Their wallet policy traps your money with no option to transfer it back to your source bank, forcing users to endure subpar service just to reclaim their funds.  \n\nThe demand for quality, reliability, and fair policies in Bangalore’s ride-hailing space is higher than ever. Who will rise to the occasion and truly transform this landscape? \n\n#CabHailing #BangaloreTraffic #BluSmart #Shoffr #QuickRide #CustomerServiceMatters #MobilitySolutions #TechForTransport  Shoffr BluSmart Quick Ride",

The app cab space first emerged on identifying the inconvenience of getting a ride, and now, has gone deeper in perfecting that niche. This evolution -\n\n1. Democratizes the app cab space challenging the dominance of hitherto major players like Ola and Uber, together with the establishment of the ONDC network across the country. \n\n2. Gives more choices to users and with the advantage of fair pricing, cutting through the monopoly of major players.\n\n3. Emphasizes the need to smooth out the edges of user experience of ride hailing to the core. Now that having a cab at your location at a click is a norm, there is a further need to make that journey more comfortable in all ways possible. Attempts in this direction can be seen in Shoffr incentivizing their chauffeurs on good behavior with riders rather than just the number of trips they complete. \n\n4. Signifies the role of emerging technologies like blockchain to meet the needs of today's users, who desire transparency and wish to be in more control of their experiences. In this regard, Drife may be cited as an example for decentralizing the ride hailing experience and promoting open governance for riders and drivers, safeguarding their best interests.\n\n5.  Bears testimony to more sections of society being comfortable with technology, provided it intertwines with their needs and adapts to make itself a part of their lives. \n\nWhile Ola and Uber made online ride hailing a norm, new players in this space represent beacons of new possibilities that user experience necessitates.\n\n#appcabs #uber #technology #userexperience",

      "content": "#FridayPost\nIn an era where #AI is increasingly the norm, it was refreshing—and admittedly bold—to come across a company like Shoffr that proudly champions human customer support. While AI-driven tools offer impressive scalability and speed, there’s something uniquely valuable about the human touch: empathy, nuanced understanding, and the ability to adapt to complex, unforeseen challenges.\n\nThat said, embracing human support comes with its own set of challenges, especially when it comes to scaling operations. As companies grow and customer expectations evolve, striking the right balance between personalized, human interaction and efficient, automated service becomes critical.\n\nI believe the future of customer support lies in a hybrid model—where technology augments human capabilities rather than replacing them entirely. How do you see the balance between AI and human engagement shaping the future of customer experience? Would love to hear your thoughts!\n#CustomerExperience #HumanTouch #AI #DigitalTransformation #Innovation",

      "content": "Shoffr \n\nI have always valued exceptional products and services, and I typically extend the benefit of the doubt to companies. However, after several enjoyable rides with Shoffr, I am now faced with a significant disappointment that raises serious concerns about driving safety—an issue that is simply unacceptable. Blu Smart began with a strong reputation but has since seen its service decline, and I fear Shoffr is heading down the same path.\n\nDefending your product and making grand claims about \"gold standards\" does not guarantee future reliability.\n\nDuring my recent ride, the driver was repeatedly on his phone, dangerously distracted, and nearly collided with several cars while running at least three red lights. He even struck a brand-new vehicle in front of a female driver, showing no remorse for the incident, which left us stranded for over an hour. When we sought assistance from your team, there was no effort to arrange an alternative vehicle; instead, we were asked to find one ourselves. Stuck on a busy road with no options, we had to endure the distressing experience of police involvement, all while your team failed to communicate any updates until we inquired about next steps.\n\nIt is essential to respect your customers' time and well-being. Relying on defensive rhetoric about \"gold standards\" means little when safety is at stake. I urge you to reevaluate your driver hiring processes and enhance training on navigation and safety protocols.\n\nAdditionally, the driver arrived 30 minutes late for our pickup at T1 Bengaluru, further compounding our frustrations.\n\n(#Shoffr #Bengalurucabs #Bengaluruairportrides #Taxi #Poorservice )",

Brands across categories are dipping into this trend to drive value like BluSmart and Shoffr redefining ride-hailing, Tira Beauty, Nappa Dori, and Miraggio in luxury beauty and lifestyle, to name a few.\n\n\nBut while we're talking about increasing share of the premium segment with rising incomes, another trend is emerging in parallel: high inequality.\n\n\nIn metros – Delhi, Mumbai, the Gini coefficient over the last 4 years hovers near 0.4, comparable to some of the highest globally – Sau Paolo, Jo’burg, London —a striking indicator. And where inequality grows, so does demand for protection, privacy, and exclusivity. That’s why sectors like private security, smart home defense, and cybersecurity for individuals are are going to enter the spotlight.\n\n\nTheft cases in Delhi alone rose steadily (205,545 in 2022 to ~210,000–220,000 estimated for 2023), driven by vehicle thefts (+5%) and house thefts (+20%). Detection rates for thefts are low (e.g., 18.4% for vehicle theft), as is the availability of state police personnel.\n\nIf global benchmarks show us a path in regions with rising disparity—Latin America, Africa, and Asia—private security is booming. South Africa’s private security market, valued at ~$4 billion, employs more guards than police, driven by a Gini of 0.63 and high crime rates. Latin America’s security market grows at 8–10% annually due to urban inequality and crime.\n\nWith India on a similar trajectory, rapid-response armed services, digital asset protection, and even private investigation services are likely to boom.\n\n\n#Premiumisation #IndiaConsumerTrends #UrbanInequality #SmartSecurity #LuxuryMarketIndia #WealthProtection #PrivateSecurity #D2CIndia #InnovationOpportunities #FutureOfSecurity\n\nData Sources: (FICCI-EY, Nasscom-DSCI), news articles (Business Standard, Economic Times, Mint), and official data (NCRB, World Inequality Database).",

      "content": "The best way to think about monetization in marketplaces (e-commerce, food delivery, ride-sharing) is to view them as a pipe connecting customers at one end to suppliers at the other.\n\r\nAs marketplaces grow, more customers and suppliers enter, but the pipe’s width stays the same, increasing competition for both. This creates monetization opportunities for the platform:\n\r\nCustomer-side monetization:  \r\n1. Priority shipping (Amazon  Prime)  \r\n2. Faster bookings (Urban Company)  \r\n3. Reduced wait times (Swiggy ONE)  \r\n4. Tipping incentives for faster service (Ola)  \r\n5. Personalized recommendations  \r\n6. Exclusive access to limited products or early sales (Flipkart BBD)\n\r\nSupplier-side monetization:  \r\n1. Paid ads for better visibility  \r\n2. Higher margins for premium listings  \r\n3. Offering exclusive discounts on the platform  \r\n4. Exclusive partnerships with the platform  \r\n5. Advanced analytics for business insights (Zepto)  \r\n6. Pay for better Logistics support and inventory management (Amazon)\r\n7. Avial Financing and insurance plans\r\n\nHowever, as the platform grows, competition intensifies, even the 'premium paid' by both customers and suppliers is not sufficient, and it pushes out those who are unwilling to pay. While dominant platforms like Myntra or Ola invest heavily to maintain near-monopoly or duopoly status by focusing on growth\nWhen incumbents start to monetize, offering a different proposition but addressing the same problem statement, new entrants (Shoffr, Rapido, or Zepto) capitalize on dissatisfied customers and suppliers, focusing on again on Growth before monetization, and then the cycle repeats. That’s the beauty of capitalism!",

The product itself is solid, well-thought-out, and clearly built with customer convenience in mind.\n\n🚘 Comfort & Quality: The premium electric SUVs make airport travel smooth, spacious, and stress-free.\n ⏳ Reliability Matters: My ride arrived exactly on time—no last-minute uncertainty.\n 👨‍✈️ Great Service: The drivers are professional, well-trained, and ensure a seamless experience.\n 🌱 Sustainable Choice: Shoffr’s EV-first approach is a step in the right direction for urban mobility.\n\nThat said, no great product is ever truly ‘done’—and Shoffr is no exception. While the ride experience was fantastic, the app could use some refinement. I personally faced a few minor glitches while booking, and I’ve noticed similar feedback from users on Google reviews. A smoother, more intuitive app experience could elevate Shoffr from being a great product to an industry leader.\nWith 70% repeat customers, Shoffr is clearly onto something big. If they continue refining the user experience, I see them becoming the go-to premium cab service in India. Excited to see how they evolve!\n\nhttp://shoffr.in/\n\n#Shoffr #ProductExperience #UserFeedback #SmartMobility #EVRevolution #CustomerFirst",

      "content": "I recently posted about BluSmart 's rise in the ride-hailing space in India. GrowthX® had put out out a very informative YouTube video summarizing the strategy and journey taken. I wanted to follow up on my previous post to cover another major aspect of BluSmart's success in India: Customer Centricity.\n\nBluSmart already had the #usp of being a transportation company with fully-electric vehicles. Done. Getting traction requires solving one or very few small problems for users. They went the airport rides route in major cities like #bangalore #delhi #mumbai. Bangalore in particular has an airport that is far away from the center of the city with no metro service or smooth public bus transport options. If you have a lot of luggage, don't wish to spend 2+ hours using public transport, or need reliability, then you were at the whims of Ola and Uber drivers that may or may not make you sweat at peak times. \n\nBluSmart basically digitized the private car service on an app as opposed to have to arrange one with a service via telephone or Whatsapp which also comes at a premium price; sometimes 30-50% more than using a ride-hailing app. BluSmart allows your to pick a date and time in advance and the driver always show up on-time and in many instances, earlier than the designated time. This concept doesn't only apply for catching flights; but for any appointment you may have. It comes at a bit of a premium, but it's reliable, consistent, and keeps customers stress-free and happy.\n\nNamma Yatri Rapido are companies in a similar space got the word out by offering a very specific feature that was very customer centric - the ability to name your price above a standard base price for autorickshaws and cabs. Uber Ola didn't offer this option. Users would be at the back and call of surge/demand pricing while not having the option to pay a premium to get a faster ride. Namma Yatri and Rapido offered this option. It was no surprise that Ola followed suit (albeit briefly) with a similar function that went away as fast it came.\n\nThe 2.0 of startups or 2.0 of 21st century crucial services is starting to emerge and companies are learning from the mistakes or even apathy from the giants that thrived on a growth-only mindset in 1.0. Interesting times ahead as these later founders and leaders are more visible, have deep experience, clear leadership teams, and are not breaking the bank by \"growth at all costs\" with long-term planning and finances.\n\n#taxi #cab #transportation Punit K Goyal Anmol Jaggi Puneet Jaggi #rikshaw Pavan Guntupalli Rishikesh SR Aravind Sanka #ride #transport #blusmart #rapido #nammayatri #customer #customercentric #brand #funding #user #uxdesign #business LinkedIn Linkedin News GrowthX®Shoffr #finance #ev #electric #pricing #energy #logistics #electricvehicle #electricity #convenience #india #app Google #business #businesscase",

This was not acceptable since I was headed to the airport to catch a flight. Luckily Uber came to the rescue with a cab arriving in 3 minutes. Very poor ops management by Shoffr & putting customers to trouble, no apology call to boot. Book Shoffr at your own peril !!!",

But with time, it lost customer trust due to bad customer experience, awful safety record and the general attitude of the founder - never take responsibility and always blame others. \n\nStill with founders in the driver seat, Ola was fighting. However, with Ankit Bhati moving away in 2019, and Bhavish distracted with Ola Electric and Krutrim (both struggling), Ola Cabs started to lag. And without stable leadership, with an average tenure of leaders being 6 months, the writing is on the wall - Ola was going to die. \n\nIts a surprise they survived this long, only because there was no competition. But with Rapido and Uber and niche players like Shoffr, customers got better alternatives. \n\nIts only a matter of time before Ola Cabs shuts down unless the company can fix 3 core issues: Leadership, Customer service and Company culture - all tie into a single central problem - Customer Trust.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\n#Ola #CustomerService",

(i.e. drive high utilization OR premium pricing OR both)\n(b) How do you scale from YY to YYY? (i.e. don’t have too many quality issues at x10 scale)\n(c) OEM risk? (i.e. will the preferred OEM continue to drop prices? And, will battery life pan out?)\n\n➡ Over the next 10 years, we should see most ICE cab fleets get replaced with such EV cab fleets. Clear winners in OEM segment are visible: Tata Motors & MG Motors India.. Will be exciting to see who wins (on the fleet operator side) in this transition!",

Shoffr has emerged as the 'gold standard' of rides in the sustainability sector. The Blusmart scandal is resulting in the migration of customers from BluSmart to Shoffr. \n\n2. The logic behind Shoffr is simple- the founders created a cab service that they would be proud to use. \n\n3. Key pain points that are being solved by Shoffr are cancellations, dirty cars, rude drivers, and haphazard support systems by existing cab aggregators. \n\n4. Shoffr, unlike its competitors, grew sustainably. Starting with just 5 EV cars in 2022! \n\n5. They raised funding from their customer base, taking $1 million from 100 happy customers. In 2024, it had an annual revenue of over 12 crore INR. \n\nBluSmart's downfall can be seen as Shoffr's rise in a similar way that League of Legends (a very popular MMORPG now) gained popularity after DOTA had a server issue in China and Korea. I can conclude that Shoffr has a bright future ahead.",

I have rarely seen a product or service in India which had so much user love and market pull. It is sad to see BluSmart going in oblivion after working hard to garner so much love. I now see Shoffr and Uber Black taxis running around in Bengaluru and other Tier 1 cities, to capture this market.\n\nHaving used Shoffr, I am very bullish on them but there are differences vis-a-vis BluSmart:\n\n- Shoffr seems to be leaning towards a hybrid model - combining driver owned EVs and fleet management.\n\n- Focused on airport transfers and corporate bookings - higher ticket sizes and predictable demand.\n\n- Possibly higher fleet utilization via B2B channels first, B2C later.\n\nTime will tell if Shoffr will crack profitability, but early signs suggest stronger operating discipline.",

Consumers want more than just a product; they seek something that aligns with their lifestyle, reflects their values, and offers more than the basics. Brands that nail this don’t just elevate their product—they create entirely new sectors. 🌟\n\nLet’s take Shoffr 🚗—it’s not your average ride-hailing app. Shoffr turned getting from A to B into a luxurious experience, offering premium vehicles, personalized services, and extra comforts that make every ride feel like a treat. It’s no longer just about transportation; it’s about giving customers a taste of the good life with every trip.\n\nSimilarly, Mokabora 🧳 didn’t just sell luggage—they redefined travel gear. With high-quality materials, sleek designs, and innovative features, they’ve turned an everyday suitcase into a premium travel companion. Customers aren’t just buying bags; they’re investing in a luxury travel experience.\n\nThen there’s Atomberg 🌪️—a company that took something as basic as ceiling fans and disrupted the market with energy-efficient, smart, and premium designs. While most fans remained the same for decades, Atomberg innovated with brushless DC motors, remote controls, and sleek aesthetics, proving that even a simple home appliance could be premiumized.\n\nApple 🍎 has done something similar with their tech. From iPhones to MacBooks and AirPods, they’ve turned everyday gadgets into status symbols. The seamless integration of their ecosystem makes each device more than just functional; it’s part of a premium experience that locks you into their world. And Starbucks ☕ did the same thing with coffee—what was once just a regular coffee is now a moment of indulgence. With personalized drinks, cozy vibes, and premium branding, Starbucks turned coffee culture into an exclusive lifestyle.\n\nBut here’s the catch: many brands make the mistake of raising prices without adding real value. ❌ When that happens, customers feel they’re being overcharged for ordinary products.\n\nSo, what’s the fix? It’s about focusing on quality and creating an experience worth paying for. Look at Dyson’s innovation or Birkenstock’s sustainable comfort—they’ve turned simple products into premium experiences that justify their price. 💸\n\nPremiumization is about delivering value that makes customers feel they’ve made the right choice. When done right, you're not just selling a product—you’re reshaping entire sectors. 💡\n\nWhat do you think about premiumization? Have you seen it create new sectors in your industry?

Having learnt from observation and experience, it intends to do things differently.  \n \nA big takeaway for Shoffr—which provides airport transfers, outstation rentals, and city rentals—is the need to focus on higher utilisation of assets, unit economics, and operational efficiency to ensure the business stays sustainable.\n \nCompetitive landscape:\nShoffr started as a bootstrapped venture, launching with a fleet of four cars. Once the fleet reached a breakeven point of 20-30 cars, the business became self-sustaining, CEO and Co-founder Vikas Bardia says. Today, the company has scaled to around 130-150 cars in Bengaluru and 20-25 in Delhi.\n\nThe company’s unique way of fundraising—from its own users and angel investors instead of traditional VC funding, was a way to give early adopters a “chance to participate in the company’s growth”, according to Bardia. While Shoffr is open to VC funding, it’s crucial to find investors who share their vision, he adds. \n\nBuilding on the experience of its competitors, Shoffr’s focus is on high utilisation and avoiding expanding too quickly. The company’s asset utilisation is over 75%, which helps keep the business sustainable, Bardia says.",

Shoffr did neither. Instead, they asked:\n\n→ What if we solved problems others overlooked?\n→ What if we focused on the right audience instead of serving everyone?\n\nHere’s what they did differently:\n1.⁠ ⁠They chose their audience wisely. High-end users—busy professionals, corporate clients, and frequent travellers who value chauffeur-driven convenience.\n2.⁠ ⁠They didn’t just offer rides; they offered experiences. Luxury vehicles, top-notch service, and unmatched reliability became their hallmark.\n3.⁠ ⁠They avoided competing and focused on solving. By partnering with corporates, event planners, and hotels, they became a trusted name in their niche.\n4.⁠ ⁠They grew through trust and excellence. Word-of-mouth and premium service turned their customers into loyal ambassadors.\n\n✨ Takeaway: Shoffr’s story is proof that you don’t need to compete with giants to win big. Smart segmentation, quality service, and solving specific pain points can take you to the top.\n\n📌P.S. What’s one “overlooked” problem in your industry that could be your breakthrough?
